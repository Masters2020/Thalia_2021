0,_RU4e3KCwQI,hey folks how's it going jovan hutton bullets are here with you this evening and you know i'm going to point out some of the hypocrisy some of the weird stuff that's going on with getting to the bottom of this 2020 election and what exactly happened i'm going to talk about a report i'll post it where you can download it yourself this particular report is a 43-page report that was released regarding election interference and they're saying that none nothing occurred at all in this election that had any way to do with anything hokey pokey at all now i believe that you believe something was wrong i want to remind you what i stand for i'm going to play a video for you as everybody gets spooled up here i want to remind you what i stand for and what i'm saying needs to happen with our election but i'm going to call out the hypocrisy because the world uses the 2012 2012 russian presidential election as the standard for proving beyond a shadow of a doubt election fraud the 2012 election in russia is the standard for proving total election fraud from top to bottom the problem is our election in 2020 has the same blueprint and the exact same problems and i'm going to show you how they're hiding this in smoke and mirrors and an article came out on forbes about this [ __ ] report i'm going to show you how they baffle you with numbers but i want to remind you what i'm going for is i want to see the physical ballots if this country was founded on a great piece of paper called the declaration of independence then i believe that we should make sure that this country doesn't get undone because of a simple piece of paper called the ballot that ballot you had in your hand when you marked it whether you mailed it or went in that is the historical document of what you intended to vote what you intended to happen and how you intended for this country to be run that is why only that ballot matters get ready share this call your friends tell them to tune in i want to remind you what i look for in ballots and then we'll get on with the program with mail-in ballots being the most contested part of this recent general election let's take a look at the ballot as a simple piece of paper paper has memory if a ballot was mailed there will be folds throughout the paper physics say that once the paper is bent it can never go back to its original shape our systems can detect this while looking at the paper ballots through our systems we're not only able to tell was the ballot actually folded and mailed but we're also able to track did it go through the postal system and get accounted for while looking at these ballots we can look closely at the votes and we can tell whether the vote was cast by a human hand or a machine the human hand marking the oval leaves telltale signs of human dynamics however if the oval was filled in by a machine it looks totally different under computer vision examination besides there should be no ballots with already filled in votes these are just a few of the things that can be detected in the paper that is the ballot and remember the paper is a piece of code as well if that paper is misprinted or misaligned it will force the voting system to ask for adjudication adjudication means somebody an administrator so uh folks i want to i want to come back to the broadcast because i i tried to protect you against [ __ ] idiots like this mv tits dwo i'm doing my best to try to block it out of the broadcast here i have no idea why i can't block this freaking idiot please see this crap google drive you know what block it scammer i'm trying to get rid of it can't get rid of it and it's unfortunate that there are idiots out there that uh try to do that but right now i don't have control for some reason uh stream yards having issues connecting with my destination uh just basically block that [ __ ] idiot out and by the way you're a [ __ ] idiot if you think that pepsi is going to give you 1900 for covered [ __ ] relief tell you what you want to sell that [ __ ] go move to ethi [ __ ] opia not here anyway let's move on because that's about that's about as ignorant right of a pitch as we're getting pitched on this election right this little idiot who just came in trying to say that pepsi is going to give you 750 relief right for covert relief for pepsi that kind of idiotic stooge who would come into a public forum and post this should be running for office here in the united states because i tell you what that idiotic stooge would qualify to basically say hey this election is great and whatever and i'm going to call this system out because i don't like idiot stooges like that period that is the stupidest crap in the world and it is the stupidest crap in the world if you think there were no problems with this election okay period so let's get right down to it in 2012 the presidential election in russia since then has been held out as the most corrupt presidential election of any country in the world period any country in the world okay however here's a report by the federal government i'm going to talk about that calls out that russian election in 2012 same with uganda and the problem is our election in 2020 mirrors what happened both in russia and in uganda so let me show you how i got tipped in this story before i got pissed off at our ethiopian brother there trying to sell us pepsi covered relief so let's go here let's share my screen uh i wish i had i wish i had a button where i could let those idiots join in right because i'd love to see some idiot in ethiopia trying to sell that [ __ ] anyway let's go okay you ready for this this is uh an article that just came out in forbes magazine okay let me see if i can pump it up for you okay and you can read the headline for yourself okay election 2020 february 19 2021 803 eastern standard time 44 667 people have read this and yes i got the same blocking area trying to block that idiot whatever it was anyway okay so you see this here it basically says there was no evidence of election fraud and battleground states now the reason they say there was no election fraud is she quotes a report called the mitre corporation analysis of the eight battleground states blah blah blah that the presidential race wasn't stolen or fraudulent even as former president donald j trump and his allies continue to claim so there you go top magazines ford magazine lord knows i love forbes magazine love steve forbes had a long-term relationship with them right but this story by this allison durkee right has no basis on fact and they're trying to baffle you with [ __ ] called this report so the first thing i want to do for you is i want to give you a peek at this report okay and in this report what they attempt to do is push off to you baffling you with numbers okay baffling you with numbers that they did all this analysis and everything's perfect so let's go look at their analysis okay that we have with this well let me find it here uh let's see what it's going to be called data analytics there you go ready boom here's the report okay it's the m-i-t-r-e mitri miter i don't care what you call it but it's the data analytics to enhance election transparency now basically this uh report that you're seeing on my screen is done by their non-partisan national election security lab check this out they're even so patriotic at their national election security lab that their team ready for this their team is called the bald eagle team the bald eagle team right anyway in this bs report of the bald eagle team they're basically saying they looked at everything from arizona florida georgia michigan north carolina ohio pennsylvania and wisconsin with a focus on anomalies that have been held up by some in the gop as potential evidence of fraud now i like the way they word these things right period i like the way they word these things okay and it's really interesting how they use smoke and mirrors and so i know i only have to go through the first for the first six pages is kind of like the outline of this it's really kind of uh impressive right let me go to the outline let me see there so you look at the outline of it and they show all these things that they're going to do in these states and so you're looking at all these states dominion dominion machines butler county pennsylvania they have this thing i like this term they use the fair election fingerprint the fair election fingerprint that's their new statistical analysis but as they baffle you with the bs of numbers i'm going to decode geeky bs and i'm going to let you kind of make your own decision so now if you look at this report i'm just going to skim through this real quick you see how they have really nice and i'm going to see if i can pump it up for you because i want you to see it they went to a lot of trouble to do nice reports okay see these wonderful beautiful charts and reports and they use all these dots and they use these big words and everything else here's one of the things that stuck out to me in it at the very beginning of this report okay basically what they say is they leverage data analytics to identify anomalies leverage data analytics to identify anomalies well the very first thing these people said to all the data scientists looking at the numbers was you can't look at statistical analysis that's worth [ __ ] that doesn't prove anything yet in their own reports they're leveraging data analytics to identify anomalies now look at this now where do they gather their information they gather their information from election websites state government-run agencies right and then they monitored this is the kicker this is the kicker they monitored the media from october through the end of december to get a real take on what was really happening so their scale to monitor this was the media that's their analysis right that was their analysis is to basically monitor monitor the media as we go back to these charts and and the one i'm going to focus on is going to show you some georgia stuff because i think you need to know it so they chart it all out and they use all kinds of interesting charts they use a lot of interesting terms they basically denied binford's law which has established one and they come up with their new one fingerprint for georgia and it basically said they did this and they base it on a particular type of analytic right that they uh their fingerprinting uh provides now their particular fingerprint is by taking a gaussian or normal distribution of zero they use kurtosa the measurement of weight of tails by the way if i was measuring some tail i don't think i would use kurtosis and i think if i was wanting to measure any type of tail if i even suspected it had kurtosis that's probably tail i want to stay away from but anyway wouldn't you let's go back to this okay and so as we get into these analytics and you're looking at it they base all these nice little charts on okay here's the ratio and here's the math by when it and here's the logarithm by which we did it and it's a normal institution which is evenly distributed although it's normally uh curved however to be fair as long as we've got a negative 2.3 kurtosis which is fine but here's what i want to point out to you the russian presidential election of 2012 which is widely considered to have high levels of fraud you see that on my screen so that's what we're going to focus on they basically said they basically said uh you're right not for me to say has it right if you have kurtosis and measuring the tail that tail needs some antibiotics right totally totally that tails looks like it's got kurtosis yes so let's stay away from tail with kurtosis right okay so yeah that's some pretty nasty stuff but the tail has kurtosis anyway so we got this report and now we're just going to dive into it they basically said in this report that there are no anomalies i'm going to do the low-hanging fruit for you first and then they said russia is the standard for proving for proving okay that fraud occurred here we go so i'm diving into this report i'll post it for you so you can go to it but remember they said okay we where we monitored me the media from october to december 2020 to monitor any anomalies and they say their data is basically uh from the pre-election information bald eagle and it wasn't me bald eagle conducted analysis on data available on election day including dala related to early voting early voting methods and return and rejection rates of early balance so they say they go right up to election day now you and us know that even in this media stuff going through december all the facts were still coming out you didn't even know all the facts we didn't even know all the facts and in january the real numbers start coming down the pipe but so but let's just say their method is perfect and we're going to kind of let them do that okay and so i want to point out to you they basically started looking at alleged ballot harvesting now do you understand what ballot harvesting is that basically means it is totally legal in some states i think it's a scam but if somebody doesn't use their ballot you can go harvest their ballot like they grow on trees wait a minute they do they do grow on trees this last year they grew everywhere right and so they can harvest the ballot and if you don't use the ballot then they can let somebody else use the ballot in your name how in the hell is that legal how in the hell is that legal but it's legal but let's look at where they did some of the ballot harvesting and what i want to point out to you is their keywords right and here's their keywords right there i don't know if you can see that it says revealed each address had a plausible reason for receiving multiple ballots so the first thing i looked at in their report is okay what they call multiple ballots is if there were 20 or more ballots 20 or more ballots that went to one location was there a reason for said ballots to plausibly be there okay now i'm gonna open my screen because i want you to follow on the math give me one minute because i want you to see if you can just follow me in what i'm going to show you here when we look at the math these politicians want us to accept as the true real and accurate math okay so take a look at this so let me go to my screen here and i'm going to share with you my calculus later screen okay and so i'm on my calculator here on duckduck.gogo okay so in georgia there's about a 10 000 vote spread in declaring the winner either being donald trump or being joe biden i'm rounding these out just hang on with me 10 000 votes it's what it's down to right now now in georgia there are 2 300 voting locations okay 2 300 voting locations that basically means that there is per priest per place to vote only a 4.3 difference in the ballot so four in four individual ballots and one basically torn into a third that's the number so you're following with me so far that's how close this thing is in georgia and that's why this next number i'm going to share for you in the report that's why it matters see it's not about big mass scale because as you saw right there to win this particular election all you needed in georgia was 4.3 votes per voting place that's it that's what this comes down to okay so that's the magic number but here's a few things that they uh pointed out they basically got called out as they and they said this was fraud and some of the things that were called out was look you had ballot harvesting all over the place you had addresses that were used as people's addresses that weren't really addresses for people but this particular report says there's all a valid reason why those had multiple addresses so let's take a look at this one of them was a college dorm in albany state now you're supposed to use your legal address that is basically that is basically the numbers you uh in order to vote you must register at your home address not a college dorm address that's not accepted but we're going to say okay on that then there were other ones to a senior center now again senior sitters couldn't get out and people went and canvassed the senior citizens said hey you're going to vote they go no can i have your ballot they took the ballot i still think that's nefarious but quote-unquote it's allowed but let's just look at it by categories right the categories are of these multiple addresses are apartments well that stands to reason everybody has the same address the department apartment complex the only interesting integers numbers in there are the fact you have different apartments oh i can accept that one and then there's one in here that was a boarding school i actually looked at the boarding school it was the darlington boarding school i actually looked it up and i looked at and they're only k through 12. so that disqualifies it right away none of these kids should be voting because they're not old enough but it is a boarding school and about 30 percent of their staff literally lives on the campus i looked up all of their staff did the math and come to find out those numbers are right but then there's a next category the biggest categories of this were health care facilities how does somebody live at a health care facility how is your voting address a health care facility now see this report justifies there's a plausible reason that somebody could live there now i can't think of a reason why you live at a health care facility i also can't find a reason why you live at the temporary homeless shelter which is another one in here right temporary homeless shelter look at that one jails you can't vote you're incarcerated convicted or whatever the case may be but a lot of these addresses were jails by the way uh mball said nursing home you're right but see it has its own category right there so healthcare is not a nursing home it has a separate category for it right there i understand that one hell it even shows a monastery and an rv park i even get that but how do you have jails homeless shelters right temporary homeless shelters like that and just generic health care facilities how do you justify that and so that's what made me first dig quite uh quite a bit deeper into this story right of hey um what should we look at these numbers because they say there's a plausible reason for receiving multiple ballots now they don't say what it is not at all they don't say what it is so let's go look at this okay so let's look at their kurtosis model okay and so this is where the numbers get really really interesting so i'm going to show you the state's real numbers the federal government's real numbers and then remember i said this particular report says the standard globally for proving election fraud is the 2012 election presidential election right in russia so let's take a look at these numbers so let me share my screen and i'm going to kind of single fire fire through them so the first one that we're going to look at is voter turnout now this is really important to understand what happens in these states now you're looking right here okay this is balapedia this is basically the definitive source for looking up anything ballot turnout okay now try to remember these numbers if you need to uh go ahead and write them down okay go ahead and write them down because i'm going to refer back to these things okay and i want you to take a long hard look at these numbers too but write them down because when i jump to the russia stuff you're either going to puke or you're going to [ __ ] your pants right because this stuff is in your face so if you look at these charts right here it basically shows that the average turnout rates in the united states based on percentages you can look at it right is about 50 there's some variables in 2016 it was a 60 turnout in 2014 38 but look over here at the opposite side of the numbers the opposite side of the numbers basically shows where people vote for the highest office this is vote for by president and basically really simple is a lot of people don't want to bother with that one but the average turnout you can clearly see is in the high 50s when you do the averages now this is where it gets really really tricky i'm talking about georgia i'm sure i'm going to show you a report in georgia i showed you how georgia can come down to any one place if just four in one third ballots that's all four sheets of paper are wrong let's call it five if five sheets of paper out of the thousands that precinct took are wrong this election changes but yet the state wants to accept a one third of one percent audit that's what they want you to accept a one third of one percent now let's look at these numbers and this is what's going to kind of wow you here let me stop sharing my screen i gave you the voter turnout by usy now let's look at the voter turnout by state very important pay attention here and the reason it's very important by state is because we're going to focus on georgia see my screen here folks this is actually the audited numbers you can look at all this gobbledygoody poop and you can get any state's average numbers okay let's kind of zoom down to where i zoomed down to georgia okay 56 35 62 40 59 38 59 55 okay there's the numbers you can look at them for yourself you can audit them for yourself the mean average when you look at georgia's numbers is when georgia gets over a weighted average of about 52 percent you need a really hard look at it because that's not their statistical average going back 20 years okay so this report that i'm reading here and what i highlighted here is they actually basically point something out that i thought was really interesting now you can get befuddled in the math all kinds of befuddled in the math okay and basically what has to happen is in this map they basically said right here see it on average 31 percent of the registered voters did not vote in the presidential election in georgia there it is right there on average 31 percent of the registered voters did not vote in the presidential election in georgia their numbers their facts their reports their standards so if we were to take a look at that information what would all these fancy charts with dots mean would they make these dots mean something else would these little dots on a paper mean something completely different if you actually understood how to reason them okay robert okay okay if you want me to okay yes you're right okay okay okay okay you ready okay anyway let's go here here we go i'm gonna share my screen okay and i'm sharing it here sharing my screen sharing my screen here going to my chrome tab okay hey okay anyway uh bingo share my screen let me tell you what you're looking at okay see this is all the okay data okay and i just want you to be okay with what i'm sharing with you okay so look at the chart over here no sorry here okay and if you look at this chart and you read it okay uh all those dots okay those are 279 dots okay and those 279 dots eh okay those dots represent 279 counties okie dokie right okie dokie okay and what you need to do is you need to understand how to understand those numbers okay so i'm going to tell you how to read these numbers okay here you go pay attention okay anyway you're looking at this chart here these are all these 279 dots that basically show where all the votes came in they audited six uh counties in georgia which represented 279 precincts these are the 279 precincts charted out what you must understand first is they acknowledge an audited number in georgia okay that 31 of the people did not vote okay uh in the presidential election so we take 31 percent off the top 31 off the top so you got 100 you subtract 31 percent 69 percent is all we should be dealing with okay let's go back and look at it so if we're looking at these charts we got to go wait a minute 69 percent say look at this if i drew a line right there at 69 percent why are all these dots over there when they readily admitted say this is turnout see at the bottom 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 percent right they already acknowledged that 31 didn't vote and so actually this chart looks like this in reality so what they're saying is if you take in the fact that 31 of the people didn't vote in the general election then all of these dots should actually be over in the gray shaded areas you get what i mean okay okay so the dots should all be in the gray shaded areas so if you're following with me right now if you're following with me right now you're going holy smokes 70 plus percent of those damn dots are above that 69 percent line what the hell's going on all righty then so let's go back and let's look at this well if if 69 if it's not supposed to be over 69 let's look at it this way what if we move the gray area for the average turnout in the gray that means there should only be one two three four and we'll combine these as five there should be five precincts that out of 279 now this is key folks pay attention to the math okay is five five out of 279 show the average that basically georgia normally shows so let's just accept okay that oh i said okay again i'm sorry let's just accept that over that average turnout we get here and so if even if i took in the highest rate george has ever had look at all the numbers that show up in this irregularity band all of these dots instantly show as irregularities over the standard when you take out the 31 that this actual report says didn't vote now you go over here to this one and you get to this various one here anything you see in the yellow anything you see in the yellow should not statistically exist based on their own data but yet they tried to convince you this is the actual report and it doesn't prove anything because we use the structure of the substructure of the analytical structure combined with the structure multiplied by the keynesian term by the bayesian bay and processor star trek nine communicator formula that we created for fingerprinting boats and they basically want to convince you that hey that's the real story right there see there's no fraud there but when you audit it when you actually look at their own numbers and they say 31 percent of the people didn't turn in well they can't explain over half of this and then when you look at the real numbers based on the state and history here's what history shows where they all should be this is definitely anomaly and if you took the highest that actually they ever did see this 72 percent up to 100 percent see how over half of them are in there that is what leaves the following to be determined now you understand the setup now that i've got the setup let me get to the meat of the matter so you can debate this with your friends that do not wish to understand do not want to understand because this is how you win the argument even in this 43 page report put out by a government agency funded by government agencies funded by the current administration to prove there was no fraud and they use all these fantastical terms which most people don't do and they use this and they put it out but when you hold it against the real numbers you see the numbers don't add up and if you take and colorize the chart so you're really looking at it in slices of a pie not just the chart that they know you won't understand what you're looking at that's where they get you but here's the real meat of the matter get ready folks it's going to be a wild ride from here here we go uh let's go with the washington post first pink there you go this is a march 4th 2012 report by the washington post now we all know that the washington post don't love themselves anything conservative and i'll be damned if they're ever going to publish anything that leads anything to uh conservative uh information but here you go they basically acknowledge that putin wins election as russian president but opponents claim widespread fall now remember this report said that russia was the standard for widespread fraud that is the standard they use in their own report that here is how it went now an interesting thing in the russia election right they basically point out that in the selection if you read this article you can find it you start looking at these numbers that you find out that they basically had activists right right here i'm going to show you i think i can pump it up for you ah and do it this way thousands of russians nationwide signed up to monitor the election sunday all-day activists reported instant after instance of multiple voting abuse abuse of absentee ballots and obstruction of observers in the russian election which is held out as the worst most corrupt election ever to be had as reported by the washington post and in a moment we're going to go to the los angeles times they said thousands of people reported that there was over voting of ballots multiple ballots being counted multiple times that there was widespread abuse of absentee ballots that's basically male imbalance hey look what we found we got all these mailing ballots we had to count them and that election observers there to confirm that the election was done legally were blocked from observing blocked from observing i love this one little quote right and they talk about it as the kremlin magic of what's going on but everybody who was in this election and and taking these numbers down in russia and documenting this every one of them basically said this is a prime example of fraud election fraud period now let's jump from the washington post to the los angeles times and let's just see if we can compare the sources and see what they basically said then washington post hang on i'm just looking at for it here my screen's not showing up right let's hang on there it is so i got to close that bear with me one moment guys uh don't need precincts don't need arizona bill uh don't need that here you go okay now i can share my screen sorry i had too many windows open okay okay here we go los angeles times now this is further after moore digging into the phony fraudulent election in russia presidential election this was submitted september 24 2012 at 12 a.m basically they said they confirmed there was widespread ballot box stuffing and they basically said not only has it been certified but this is widespread and it's as bad as uganda even in this one where this owned with this report remember i mentioned earlier i don't expect you to remember it benford's law that they basically said was trash well look at this on this particular one they basically said that benford's law right is what looks for irregularities so in 2012 it was great but when it's used for anything for conservative it's wrong here it is ready for this in the model that they use to detect the fraud in the russian election they says if an election has areas that have extremely high voter turnout anything pushing up closer to that hundred percent mark than it is that that turnout is most likely a fraud and the way they determine it is do they go over the norms is there a big bulk turnout for one candidate predominantly does that sound familiar one candidate getting tons of votes at the last minute here it is even in the la times they basically said the fix is lightly in this is audited this has been audited and studied over and over and over they all mimic what goes on in russia and uganda and uganda where they basically said it is an incompetent election that benefits the few here it is writers the washington post the los angeles times this report claiming that's the standard and they baffle you with [ __ ] to tell you nothing happened when exactly the same things happened exactly the same things happen period exactly the same things happen there you go folks you have the numbers you can look at them yourself you can look up this mitre report there it is paid for by the government you don't have to look at irregularities irregularities and voting algorithms you don't even have to look at dead people or any of that all you have to do is look at the notorious trends in bas the worst presidential fraud in history which every expert agrees was done in russia in 2012 and you found out they ran ballots multiple they stuffed ballot boxes they put ballot boxes everywhere they basically over flooded the market with uh mail-in ballots and they would not let election observers actually watch up close they kept them afar taped up the windows or intimidated them not to being there there you go there you go this is what you must arm yourself with these are the facts you need to know i suggest you go back and watch it i suggest you go read about the 2012 russian election actually i think they actually learned from that 2012 election in russia how to do it here and they did it this is it i appreciate all your support okay i appreciate all your support okay okay okay thank you okay okay i love it i'm just trying to get you the numbers because if you can understand the numbers then you can understand how to debate it with all the people that tell you nothing happened that there was no fraud to see here i don't have anything special over anyone else i've decided to stop relying on some of these nefarious reports and just get to the facts but our american voting system is broke i'm a technology guy and i would never ever trust a damn machine again when it comes to voting i wouldn't it's not worth it we have to get back to individual ballots that cannot be counterfeited let me give an example of one of the smoke and mirror tactics they use did you know in these voting machines that if they take a blank ballot nobody voted it but it's about and they feed it into the machine it just stores it over here did you know that and it stores it as a legal vote asking hey what do i do with this but you remember when our systems went down we stopped counting well you can go and look at voting who voted who was registered who didn't show up and did you know did you know you can fill those in that got scanned in i just showed you it only takes five ballots at any one place to change this election five five that's all it takes five blank ballots in a machine can be voted later if you can look at the list of who didn't show up on your list and just put their names on it but it was a voted earlier these machines are designed for loopholes if we're going to fix this folks it's just us if you want justice it's just us it's not going to be up to politicians it's going to be up to the american public to basically say we don't trust these machines if you listen to my podcast i showed you how both the netherlands ireland's another one says we don't trust these machines we have to get rid of these machines and systems we have to get rid of these machines and systems and we've got to go back to paper that cannot be hacked and if there's a problem with your vote it spits it out right then and makes you fix it right then and there not holding it later for somebody else to decide what you intended how can you get the states to reject the machine look at your states ohio i think is about to uh uh spend 180 million dollars on some of these new machines that everybody's questioning and it's right if it happens again it is our fault painless you got it if it happens again it is our fault yes ohio just stopped in it and yes michael i'm weird as [ __ ] but that's the way it is okay and take it from this weirdo right i'll keep fighting this battle until i find out how to make this

button and if you like my work the best way you can support me is by sharing my videos with your network of friends and family the more viewers i get the more that channel grows the more shows i can keep producing for you okay let's get right to our show of the day after all knowledge is power it has been about three months now since the 2020 presidential election and although the corrupt mainstream media aren't reporting on it the true patriots are still dealing with uncovering the massive fraud that resulted in the stolen election the left knows and fears that the truth of this stolen election will and is coming to light just look at how they're handling themselves kamala harris waited until january 17th just two days before inauguration to give up her senate seat meanwhile barack obama gave up his seat november 16th in 2008 just days after winning the 2008 presidential election the left called in tens of thousands of national guard soldiers to police the capital in the days leading up to biden's inauguration and now still weeks afterwards thousands of those soldiers are still there with no sign of them being sent home soon the capital has barricades and barbed wire fences surrounding it it looks more like a scene from a war-torn third world country than the united states of america and perhaps the most telling sign of their guilt and fear of what will happen once it's all uncovered is their overwhelmingly fierce and unconstitutional attack on our freedom of speech they are insane right now trying to silence any and all talk of the stolen election the fraud biden's illegitimate presidency etc now let's pause for a second here and put this into perspective make sure you're sitting down because the hypocrisy will knock you over let's recall how from the second that donald trump won the presidency in 2016 the democrats were screaming fraud calling trump an illegitimate president and then for years crying russian collusion wasting 32 million dollars of our tax money trying to prove the collusion hoax according to cnbc of course it was all a sham cooked up by the criminal democrats and so not a shred of evidence was ever found to support their russian collusion claims so the left can fabricate a russian collusion in 2016 without a shred of evidence scream illegitimate president trump for almost four years but when there's actual hard evidence of widespread and massive voter fraud in several states in the 2020 election citizens are not allowed to question it or even talk about it if you do then you're anti-american you're a traitor and you must be silenced at all costs and your life must be destroyed only the left can scream election fraud when they don't win but if they steal an election then you'd better not even dare talk about it or you'll be persecuted tucker carlson did a story on the florida conservative journalist doug mackey who was arrested in january by the biden department of justice because he produced memes about the 2016 presidential election which donald trump won of course take a look well looks like this is the part of the revolution where they start throwing their political opponents in jail wow that was fast it was just a week ago they were telling us about unity remember that what we didn't know at the time is they meant that everyone with power should unite against the rest of the country unity meant oligarchy oh doug mackey learned that the hard way this morning mackey is a 31 year old conservative journalist from florida at 7 am fbi agents showed up at mackey's house they threw him in handcuffs and they dragged him to a cell he now faces 10 years in prison his crime he made fun of powerful democrats on social media as the federal criminal complaint puts it quote mackey made coordinated use of social media to spread disinformation relevant to the impending 2016 presidential election this disinformation the bide administration solemnly explained quote often took the form of memes yes memes online mockery mockery online is now illegal when it's aimed at the wrong people doug mackey hurt their feelings so they put him in jail according to joe biden's justice department doug mackey violated 18 u.s code section 241 he did this by tricking people like the dastardly trickster that he is into not voting in the presidential election what's interesting is that prosecutors showed no evidence whatsoever that doug mackey actually tricked anyone into anything voting or not not a single person tucker goes on to say that but hold on a minute as a legal matter have you ever read 18 us code section 241 probably not but you should look it up when you read it you will learn that joe biden's justice department is lying in a very obvious way and that should make you very nervous it turns out that federal law does not ban memes or for that matter misinformation whatever that is the law that biden's prosecutors are citing instead prohibits quote conspiring to injure oppress threaten or intimidate anyone from exercising the right to vote according to the law that would include kidnapping voters invading their homes sexually abusing them doug mackey didn't do any of that not even close to any of that doug mackie made memes therefore he's a domestic terrorist speech is violence dissent is a felony what you may be wondering does a case like this mean for the first amendment well it means that it's effectively suspended you can now be arrested for saying the wrong things and at seven a.m this morning one journalist actually was arrested for that now i myself have experienced the censorship of the left first hand when last month youtube removed my video that i posted in december which discussed the dueling electors that seven states sent to congress for the january sixth vote i don't mean they shadow banned it they've been shadow banning my channel for a while now cutting my reach deleting subscribers removing comments etc no this time they deleted my entire video poof gone as if it never existed they sent me an email about it saying quote content that advances false claims that widespread fraud errors or glitches changed the outcome of the united states 2020 presidential election is not allowed on youtube so youtube is saying if you don't think the way youtube thinks even if what you think is the truth then it's not allowed on their platform of course i challenged them and i dared them to prove that what i was saying was not true they ignored my challenge because we all know that they can't prove what i said wasn't true what i said is true 100 the link to that censored video is in the description section below the video is still up on my rumble channel now on a much larger scale let's look at the censorship of mike lindell's new documentary called absolute proof which is a two-hour in-depth look at the hard proof of widespread election fraud that took place in the 2020 presidential election mike posted his documentary on his youtube channel february 5th and it was pretty much immediately taken down by youtube of course you can't access it on mike's twitter account either since twitter banned him and they recently banned his company's account as well thankfully you can watch the documentary on mike's website the link to that website is in the description section below and i highly recommend you watch the video in his documentary mike interviews some key witnesses to the vast and widespread fraud that took place in november in multiple states arizona nevada michigan pennsylvania wisconsin georgia what he covers shows more than enough to overturn biden's supposed win here's a peek at some of what mike shares in his report as noted in part of mike's documentary there are still several election fraud lawsuits going on right now to name a few attorney matthew diperno's case in antrim county michigan is still being litigated dr shiva ardurai a systems scientist and engineer mit grad who ran for senate and lost his primary due to election fraud through the electronic voting machines as he believes still has his case pending in massachusetts attorney sydney powell's michigan case the trump campaign's pennsylvania lawsuit and their wisconsin lawsuit and then the pennsylvania lawsuit brought by representative mike kelly as well as lynnwood's georgia lawsuit are all still active in the united states supreme court although the supreme court has not decided yet if it will hear evidence on any of those cases so the million-dollar question everyone is asking is what happens if some or all of these lawsuits are won and fraud is proven what's the recourse at that point well if the fraud is determined to be sufficient to flip the supposed biden win in enough states to change the electoral college votes such that president trump actually won the election then we've got an unprecedented situation never has a presidential election been overturned once the alleged winner has taken office and our constitution does not provide a process for administering elections and in fact article 2 section 1 explicitly gives the power to elect the president to the states individually thus over our nation's history the laws and processes around national elections have grown up in a piecemeal fashion and as a result there aren't clear procedures for how to handle questions of legitimacy after the fact especially when those questions involve the presidency however even though there's no precedence on how to deal with a possible illegitimate presidential election there is precedence for removing offices other than the president from their office if election fraud is proven for example in 2003 the indiana state supreme court ruled that a special election had to be held when it was proven in court that there was fraud in the mayoral race in the town of east chicago indiana we see another example last year when a new jersey judge ordered a new election to be held for a disputed patterson new jersey city council seat just weeks after the apparent winner and a sitting councilman were charged with voter fraud because there is no precedence for presidential election to be overturned months after the supposed winner took office it's left to conjecture and it's clear that legal experts disagree about whether courts can order presidential elections to be held again i personally am of the mindset that a redo of the presidential election would be justified under the constitution if fraud is proven of course the re-vote would only be done in the states where the fraud is proven and not in the entire country but our constitution is clear the power is given to the states to determine how to conduct a presidential election so if someone breaks that state's election laws to win whether intentionally or unintentionally then the election needs to be redone minus the fraud and whomever wins wins many of you have asked me whether or not biden can be impeached if the evidence of fraud is finally heard in court and proven the constitution obviously provides for the impeachment of a sitting president but that process is focused on individual wrongdoing by the president not electoral fraud or irregularities article 2 section 4 says the president vice president and all civil officers of the united states shall be removed from office on impeachment for and conviction of treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors so unless it is proven that biden himself was implicit in the fraud that got him into the white house then no impeachment could not be used to remove him based on a stolen election as we come to the end of our show for now i'd like to hear what you think about the continuing fight to uncover the election fraud and the left's hypocritical agenda to silence and punish anyone who dares to question the 2020 election and its myriad of illegal votes and procedures do you see the importance of continuing to uncover the fraud even if it does not affect the outcome of the 2020 election if the fraud is uncovered now then the processes that led to the fraud can be changed such that it won't happen again in the future stay with me people subscribe to my channel share my videos and come find me on rumble meewy [ __ ] shoot and parlor once they're back up and running thanks again for watching until next

2,zSYp919GLhk,no man i can't watch the news anymore i can't watch uh reporters interviewing reporters putting that out as fact and truth when it's just merely an opinion and yet they expect us to digest it internalize it and take it as the truth i won't do that anymore you know when covert 19 can be the only story on the news since early in 2020 and yet there's so much information out there about child sex trafficking pedophilia trafficking minors across countries borders international and it's crept into the highest echelons of our government federal state local politicians being arrested trafficking minors uh i don't see uh i don't see how the mainstream media can ignore that story and have covet 19 coverage 24 7. you know this is not about democrats and republicans pedophiles are on both sides they don't know they don't discriminate by political party they don't even discriminate by age of the minor yeah that's right that's right government leaders involved in trafficking babies the stories are out there you can find them you just have to look you'll find some of the biggest names involved the biggest names in politics involved or associated with the practice it gets really dark if you follow the stories the stories get very dark it's a cultural thing with these people they run in a circle or circles they know each other they protect each other the american citizens have ceded power to these individuals that's right individuals involved in pedophilia that are responsible for the safety and well-being of the american public they affect our education system they oversee child protective services they impact our health care our military think about it think about those kinds of people with that much power and they've chosen to make covet the most important story are they trying to shine the light away from themselves i don't know i don't know the answer to that question but that question needs to be asked the question needs to be asked why is pedophilia not a national story america we need to wake up we need to bring this darkness into the light it's got to stop ,2
3,h08n4LNzKTU,hey y'all now dmx of course passed away and i'm trying to put two and two together um back back in the day he had this album called uh flesh my flesh blood of my blood now i couldn't find the um the the video of him where was not of him as uh why dean from rough riders uh saying that this blood is basically chicken blood and he and he's in the tub so you know like that that just

coke ritual was that you know with with the tubs and you know uh there was a uh other artist that was in tubs like uh i believe lil wayne was in the tub with the six foot seven foot video when he fell back in the tub and then tupac of course when he was in the tub now what goes on is that it it had his death happen this week which is uh you go to a list of say 10 holidays this is say 10 holidays

easter week so that's why it says date varies right here and what they do is the blood sacrifice see it says human sacrifice of course male or female female adult you know so and it's in this eye that you know all these celebrities are dying at the age of 50 and you know they're dying at the age of 50. and the thing is you know they all seem to be dying of you know drug overdoses there was a um video let me see if i can find it uh let me see there was a video uh dmx had the uh took the so-called vaccine there was a video i can't i can't find it right now dmx uh okay why was that it's not popping up it's not popping up right now dmx dies nice after that well i'm after i'm gonna have to look forward later well yeah he did he did uh take the vaccine and this it was said uh by the uh family members i guess uh the family members had said something about uh family members had said something about uh what you call it yeah right here hey guys check this out i just got it certified from home i don't have the editing tool uh i know y'all don't want to watch that but you know yeah they go with a little break but i did want to give you guys this update so listen very closely a family member of dmx has exclusively spoken with mto news and let them know that there was a possibility that the kovid 19 vaccine could be a factor into how dmx suffered his heart attack and is now currently fighting for his life in a white plains hospital now previous reports have said that dmx did indeed od on some kind of narcotic or drug which led to him having a heart attack and not receiving oxygen for 30 minutes which led to him having to go to the hospital with possible levels of brain damage due to the lack of oxygen but this family member believes that after dmx took the coven 19 vaccine a week ago in hopes that he could get back on the road and start traveling and performing again that that's how everything went left now i'm not sure who the family member is because the family member is not named but they do not believe that there were any drugs involved in this occurrence so i really want you guys to sound off in the comments and let me know do you think that there is a possibility that maybe drop yeah well the vaccine is killing a lot of people you know a lot of people are dying of this vaccine of course if you look deep into uh you know their adverse effects now this is just for europe now i know when um i know in um uh the united states i believe they are um only one they only report up to one to ten percent one to ten percent according to the doctors now of you know like people dying uh was a reporter that recently died um and you just just start start start looking at all these all these deaths and all these heart heart attacks and all these other stuff you know and you just you just you just got to do your research all these deaths all these vaccines you know they they only make uh they only make vaccines that's uh you know eighty percent is is is not eighty percent of the population is not gonna uh it's not gonna um have too bad of effects but twenty percent usually is the the key number usually but yeah you you see what's going on so i guess they shot him up at the age of fifty but with these deadly vaccinations and you know god got him up out of here and uh you know that that chicken blood stuff you know i should i should look that up chicken chicken blood rich what is that chicken blood chicken blood ritual power in the blood they bring sheep uh i don't know i'll look up that later voodoo headless chickens yeah chicken blood for the soul animal ritual oh man animal sacrifice animal sacrifice ritual killing offering of an animal it's a religious ritual um so that so there you there you have it you know that's just that's just the way i'm i'm looking at things you know ritualistic you know the cult of you know uh these sacrifices that you're gonna make in these uh music business this is my opinion ,2
4,_C5zYr4VNsE,"people say yeah but we've gone around the world we've circumnavigated - well don't we do yeah people have gone round around the garden that way west to east and East to us nobody has gone north to south circumnavigation wonder why nobody's gone that way round they've just gone that way around or that way around it took a guy three and a half years to go around in the early days in his sailing ship and he never got past that ice ring you know that one round here the one that is heavily guarded so having said that then I am more convinced than ever that we live on a flat plane you can wax lyrical about the Bedford canal the experiment where there's six miles two men with a theodolite looking at one another no curvature on six miles the Suez Canal 60 miles long I think no curvature you can zoom into a ship that looks like is going over the edge and you can zoom it back into full view no curvature you see are we not traveling around around around at 1,600 miles an hour whatever they say it is I don't even bother looking at the bloody numbers now what's the point the satellite myth you see that's great it's a great money spinner this satellite business you know why because your mobile phone and our telephone and our television our satellite Sat and our sat-nav systems they wouldn't work without satellites yes they would they have to because there's no satellites it's called pass the parcel all over our land if you can bother to open your bloody eyes there are aerials repeated stations aerials aerials air mirrors every bloody way you look and when you go out of town there's not that many aerials you suddenly don't get a very good mobile phone signal do you but if the satellite is way up there you should have a continuously brilliant signal you don't know do you see it's passed the parcel you send a signal out it hits the nearest state Ariel to you that's tuned into your frequency and that sends it to its mate who sends it to his mate who sends it to a central collection point hub and that hub sends it down fiber-optic cable maybe if you're phoning abroad under to sea and they've been laid since 1956 miles upon miles upon miles like a network a spider's network under our oceans and they're that thick how do you think a company or a sorry a country like Japan or China can just switch off the internet if they wished to stop their viewers looking at stuff we can look at oh it's very simple they turn the [ __ ] we've beat their station off there's nothing to talk to they go la la they go death and they can switch it back on folks whenever NASA send pictures NASA never straight answer of our alleged space out there with the ISS and out to space the moon landings where all our satellites there are no satellites get it in your head your sat-nav works by repeater stations your motorway network speed cameras work by repeater stations everything works by radio and bouncing off and using our dome remember the center paths or our ionosphere the outs nobody is managed to break through the firmament to get a rocket up there number one number two is if the rocket technology got through the firmament because space is allegedly a vacuum there's nothing for the rocket to push against so how can it propel itself forward the best case scenario in a vacuum it was spinning around like it twice and kill the occupants and then we have the Van Allen belt let's not even discuss the plan now on that there's no space travel understand that it's a method that NASA used to cream off money of the idiots to pay for deep underground military bases there is a parallel civilization underground equally as large as America underneath America and it ate for you and it ain't for me it's got high speed high speed travel it's got such they keep it for themselves we are here at their bidding to serve them it is them who want to keep it suppressed it is them who are feeding us full of [ __ ] about the occasional picture of Mars their Christ's sake we can't get stuff right on this planet how we can't take a proper photograph of the earth yet they send back pictures from millions and millions of millions of millions of miles away from [ __ ] Mars are you having a laugh it's a bit like the Cobblers children have no shoes don't you think of course we live on a flat [ __ ] earth finally you want to know why the times are not affected by the bloody moon another scammin alive because our seas are all connected and they if you look in the Bible and I really just freak you don't need to be there is in the deep oceans of our world a layer of super sailing and twice a day that rises and sinks super sale I'm enormous a line won't mix so as the super say line comes up like your breathing the tides come in as the sailin comes down the tides go out simples but no it's not it's the moon that is it's the moon you [ __ ] but listen then if it's the moon that affects the tides why doesn't the tides make the non salt water lakes in our world have tights you see I go fly-fishing at graphing waters in Cambridge which is pretty big and I don't have to worry about the water rising and falling twice a day because it's the moon is coming around and it's the tides coming in the tides going out but even the huge lakes of our world the freshwater lakes of our world don't raise a bloody millimeter when the tides are coming in and out how come the moon doesn't affect them there's nothing to do with the bloody moon the tides if you wanna know the truth the Sun probably has a little effect on it but not the moon the Sun is no more than 3500 miles high and noise the bloody moon the moon is a disc it is a flat disc it is not a bloody ball but I just want to look at the flat earth I'm still trying to get my head around it folks still learning I'm still listening to Eric Dubay I'm still looking at the preponderance of evidence but I'm convinced more than ever now I don't I I am NOT embarrassed now I've got past that point I've come out if you know what I mean I've come out it's about I'm gay I'm not gay but I've come out I'm a flat earther and proud of it absolutely because I ain't no sheep and I ain't no dick it if you want to carry on being a baller you be a baller it is not my business to convince you of otherwise because you're perhaps not ready yet for the shock that you've been lied to by the governments of the world and it's been in some national deceit maybe you're a little you're not cooked yet you not I mean come on folks get real the stars are slight years away I can video stars with my Nick on p900 they look [ __ ] close to me and if they were trillions and trillions and light-years away I wouldn't be able to see dick but I can spot him and I can look at different colors and their little dancing mazes for me their little magic little things and every one of them is unique don't give me the Northern Line [ __ ] don't give me the southern hemisphere Northern Hemisphere there's no hemispheres for Christ's sake one a flat plain hemisphere is half a sphere we're not on a sphere we're on a flat plane get it into your head nothing you say will convince me otherwise [Music] over to you to do your own due diligence for me I'm gonna go look at my new standard map of the world and marvel that how is that they've pulled it off on the world's population so beautifully to treat us like [ __ ] morons ",3
5,W1bihTBdEbM,[Music] hey guys it's your girl the southern conspiracies back with another video and today we're going to be talking about whether beyond satan is in the illuminati of course beyond satan is many things to many people muse icon trailblazer sasha fierce but there is one label that she may not be so quick to claim illuminati the pop goddess has been dogged with rumors links to the super secret society for years with conspiracy theories pointing to her and her husband jay-z as the reigning king and queen of the centuries old organization which they very much very much are and is apparent in their lifestyle and in their photos but i digress but how did the lemonade singer come to be associated with the illuminati in the first place and who are what are the illuminati anyway and perhaps most importantly why does it matter if she is in fact a reigning member of the secret society good questions not so easy answers queen bae's affiliation with the illuminati actually stems from her relationship with her husband jay-z who has been linked to powerful secret society since the late 1990s as hopeful rose is obsessed with a string of platinum albums starting with the 1996 reasonable doubt expanding in my lifetime volume 1 volume 2 heart not life and volume 3 life and times of s carter conspiracy theories began to speculate that the music mogul's powers extended beyond mere talent and bravado in their eyes jay-z was actually a member of the illuminati an exclusive group made up of the intellectual and political elite which literally runs the world here we go [Music] we'll do frame by frame here comes here it comes there it is there's a demon face you can see it look at it there it is there she is there's the old demon face it's a little bit add that to the fact that the signature hand sign for jay-z's rock nation involves holding up both palms and a triangle formation believed to be a nod to the triangle symbol that represents the illuminati and it starts to become clear how and why theorists see hints of the couple's membership everywhere beyonce's stunning 2013 super bowl performance for instance gave conspiracy theories whiplash when she flashed the rock nation hand symbol at halftime a move theory was pointed to as evidence of her allegiance to the illuminati and mind you that the lights of the eagle out during their performance for exactly 33 minutes numerology plays a big part there was also points to beyonce's music videos which are notoriously rife with symbolism as hints at the singer's double life as the queen of the illuminati her grammy nominated but notably not winning 2008 music video for single ladies has drawn particular interests from theorists with some claiming that messages can be heard when the song is played in reverse the far reaches of the internet even links beyonce's rise to fame with r b singer elias untimely 2001 death with theories claiming that allele was killed because she had tried to get out from under the illuminati's control according to that narrative aaliyah was meant to be the rifle queen of the music industry but after her death beyonce stepped in two and it took her place and she took jay-z too [Music] [Applause] [Music] beyonce and jay-z aren't the only hit makers who are suspected of being members of the elusive illuminati either whitney houston justin bieber bono eminem nicki minaj lil wayne and dr dre are among those who believe to be among those chosen as ones as well using their collective powers to lead the new world order her but as of now none of those theories have been confirmed though beyonce has been forced to address the ever-present conspiracies in the best way and she knows how in her song her 2016 hit formation even kicks off with a line hitting back at the rumors y'all haters are corny with that illuminati miss she croons in the first refrain pretty soon though the hook kicks in and fans quickly forgot about the illuminati reference instead watching her tackle much more important issues a convenient distraction perhaps [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] well folks there you have it you make your own decisions you make your own determinations as always protect your energy protect your peace like share and subscribe until next time ,2
6,L3LINJ3YIE4,all right so 911 fear-mongering if they can make everybody afraid we get everybody have to trust the government it's just one step in their plan world domination to make them to make everyone trust them a lot of people still think 911 was enacted to start the iraq war that's not really part of it because iraq iran saudi arabia pakistan they were involved i believe it was like the saudi arabian i don't know like council like a hyatt like president i got the iraq president i'm not sure i'm getting my country's mixed up but just bear with me is why i never make videos on this because little details come and go he was in washington dc the day of 9 11. and osama bin laden saddam hussein osama bin laden's family was given refuge and one of the pilots came forward later and said i'm a student i'm alive the pilot i i'm alive i'm not dead i'm here i've never been a terrorist i don't understand why this why they picked me why this happened so you know on the same day there were other drills for buildings being hit by airplanes or drills for other buildings being hit by airplanes people at the fsa we're told we're doing a bunch of drills today airplanes hitting buildings so you know just be aware of that be be advised that there will be fake airplanes hitting uh buildings boston chicago la detroit it happened everywhere that's why there were so that's why there was so much confusion that's why they couldn't intervene because they were warned ahead of time another thing is on the day of 9 11 there were more absences from work than ever before most of them being high up ceos just happened to go on emergency family vacations like the day before going out of the country which is which is really [ __ ] up and they sacrificed all these american lives because it's one thing to make a threat and say oh there's a threat and scare the american people into believing you but if you really if the terrorists really kill 3 000 people and just demolish two huge buildings that's a reason to be afraid that's a reason to turn and say who can save us what are we going to do as a people we're scared who can save us ah your government steps in and saves the day but now there's going gonna be half there's gonna have to be a lot of security measures we're gonna have to look in your bags we're gonna have to see what you have all the time look in your shoes no liquids on airplanes honestly if you read the 9 11 commission report there's a really telling amount of inconsistencies i'm brushing my teeth because i'm a good person i had these thoughts while i was brushing my teeth i'm not gonna stop brushing my teeth and you know what it's caused a hell of a lot of anxiety for the american people if you watch interviews after 9 11 terror terror terrorists terrorists terrorists terrorists terrorists terrorists terrorists terror terror terrorists terrorists they repeat that word so much and one of the best techniques of like brainwashing literally is repetition um at that there's no one after us i mean there are people that you know would love to engage in war with the with america but i mean explain to me why out of nowhere on 9-1-1 day they like they would come and attack us and even think about flying a plane into a skyscraper there's major reinforcements on skyscrapers how do you think i mean they've made them so safe and like people just ignore the jet fuel can't melt steel beams they just ignore that fact because i understand you're comfortable believing what happened it's a big thing of pride to denounce 9 11. but pretty much everyone in my generation knows that it's fake to the point that it's a joke to the point that it's literally a joke jet fuel burning temperature jeff wheel is a pair it has an auto ignition temperature of 410 degrees fahrenheit steel melting point steel melts at a temperature it's a four digit and there's different types of steel alloys yeah the melting point of stainless steel is 2550 to 2790 degrees uh let's see melting points of a low steel alloy which is 2 610 fahrenheit lead has a melting point of 621 degrees aluminum melts at 1200 18 degrees so it's not even close it's not even close it's uh it's hundreds thousands of degrees off um so that's that's a major i mean that in and of itself says a lot and i searched really hard i tried to find a lot of um i tried really hard to find videos of other skyscrapers being hit by airplanes which i know has happened which i know is something that has to happen before it the world trade center was hit by an airplane i believe in the 50s or the 40s now the world trade center i'm at the empire state building was hit by a plane and here's the thing about skyscrapers and planes um when a plane hits a skyscraper skyscrapers are reinforced i'm doing research in the moment number of steel beams world trade center facts and figures let's see so there were 110 stories in each tower 1360 something both of them feet in height let's see 50 000 people work there 200 000 tons of steel used in the construction of the world trade center 425 000 cubic yards of concrete used let's see a few foundations miles of eating cups of coffee fun fact 30 000 cups of coffee served each day 17 babies born at the world trade center i want construction i want to find the information on the steel beams that's that's what i want all right let's find it these uh multiple different grids of steel were used in the construction 12 in fact now i'm using science.howstuffworks.com um i guess i will make a little bibliography so these grades begin at a very common type of steel known as a36 which has a strength of 300 or kilo pounds per square inch that's a lot that's 30 that's 36 kilo pounds per square inch and they got progressively stronger all the way up to steels that had yield strengths of 100 kilopounds per square inch this is from the sources fema so a36 steel which is a mix of carbon and iron like all steels can handle 36 000 pounds per square inch of pressure before it begins to deform um so in the lower levels the thickness of the external walls was around four inches at higher floors it could be as thin as one quarter of an inch the construction of the floors themselves a mix of a36 steel so that strong one 36 and astm a 242 steel was used so astm a 242 is what is known as a high strength low alloy steel which means it was extra strong allowing less of it to be used which makes for lighter building so overall 200 000 tons of steel were used to build what were at the time of their construction the largest buildings on earth source ross something someone named ross it's here i'm putting the link in the description so now it says let's find out what happened all that steel so one of the most consistently used facts by 9 11 conspiracy theorists is that the grade of steel used in the world trade center simply couldn't melt at the temperatures fires created when jetliners slammed into the structures and they're right steel's melting point is 2 750 degrees fahrenheit yet jet fuel only burns between 800 and 1500 degrees fahrenheit so what happened on that september morning that caused the towers to collapse it says the steel bent even though the girders that comprise the towers wouldn't turn to molten steel in the jet fuel fire they did weaken in the heat in fact it says they could have lost half their strength also no the other items in the building were on fire um so according to the national institute of standards and technology or the nsi nist the nist even these fires combined with the impact of the planes would not have been enough to bring the buildings down their their official report concluded that the real culprit was the fact that fire proofing materials were dislodged during the impact and this in turn exposed vital structural components to the heat as these components lost strength the floors began to sag pulling the weakened columns inward and leading to a chain reaction that a floor collapsing upon floor until the buildings no longer stood and the 911 collapse these buildings fell at free fall speed i believe it takes i think i saw this somewhere it takes like 13 seconds to drop a penny off the world trade center or like 15 seconds the buildings collapsed in i think 11 seconds with literally 200 000 metric tons just of steel let alone all the concrete all the wood all the on the all the the desks the the people all that weight it collapsed at free fall speed that's not natural uh that's that's what a controlled demolition is um the other thing is when it fell it was obliterated to dust dust uh one of the firefighters said the only the biggest piece of debris he found was a phone handle um yes i know there were tons of steel and concrete that collapsed and crushed things below but all these things were found and then one completely unscathed intact passport coincidentally of one of the hijackers another development on saturday new york officials revealed at a news conference here in the city that a hijacker's passport was found blocks from the world trade center crash site if you can believe that no other details were given but the discovery prompted the fbi and police to expand their the search area down in lower manhattan so why didn't that burn in the fire why you know what i mean why was that right on top of the rubble it's interesting once you start opening your mind to the fact that people can lie to you and it's pretty easy because we want we want to trust our leaders that's our instinct is to trust the leaders but and i'm not too far in like i'm not like i think flat earth is the stupidest thing i've ever heard mostly because um i'm a very spiritual person and i've connected with the earth you know if you haven't gone out and connected with the earth before and felt the vibrations and you know drew energy and exchanged energy hey you're missing out b you can't be fully awake if you're not spiritually connected um so i think flat earth is stupid like the fact that there are mirages out at sea like where the like the boats look like they're floating in air i believe that that actually comes from the curvature of the earth and bending and like the light fractals like bending around and you know i see planets you know and there are consistencies there's constellations and a flat earth isn't real then astrology is not real um and i believe in that i believe that you know the planets and the stars we are connected to the universe you know if even one person didn't exist or one thing happened differently than it did this universe wouldn't exist so we're literally all one uh young pharaoh wisely said you know our brains are like computers and our mind is like the internet because everyone connects on a mind level you know you can be like oh people just talk to each other but that in and of itself is connecting on a mind level to be able to think and process the greeting you want to give someone and then and having them understand it and return it that's literally working on the same network of mines like the same network of neurons and when you break it down we're actually all made of atoms and molecules we're all made of the same [ __ ] so we literally are just part of one big growing evolving adapting system you know so energy can neither be created nor destroyed and it's a proven fact that there's that there is a spirit that there is a part of consciousness that science can't explain with just experiments and test tubes and measurements and [ __ ] it's the kites consciousness and we all share that even plants and animals i mean it's proven if you speak kindly to plants they will grow and they will blossom and flourish and if you yell at plants they respond negatively these are all just things that i've learned over time and my mom and my sister have been like why don't you make videos about this and i get nervous because what if i miss a piece of information what if i say something wrong and like people come at me i don't like confrontation but i think it's about time people understand you know people are going to come at me and say well where's your proof where's your evidence i mean watch a couple documentaries you know i in a way i'm communicating to people who don't believe this but there's also there are also people that already do know these things that i'm just communicating with in the sense that we both know what's happening we are both existing on the same plane of knowledge um and understanding so you have to understand you have to understand that you're you've all in america for example you've already been conditioned to believe lies um christopher columbus i'm reading about this now christopher columbus was upheld as this amazing figure this american hero uh yeah he didn't discover america you can't you can't discover a place right you can't be the original pioneer discoverer of a place if there's already people living there you see and there were so many americans already here native americans tens of millions of them and when he went down to south america he i mean he enslaved so many native americans there were 10 million that he had and by the end um by the end there was like 12 000 i think or some ridiculous number like that um and he sex trafficked the girls he said you know have your pick basically have your pick a fresh young [ __ ] and by young i mean in his travel locks he kept very kept meticulous logs they had ship logs that they would keep because they didn't have electronics so they would follow the stars and in order to follow the stars on a cloudy night you can't see the stars so you have to look at your star log your ship log and kind of guess guess where you are based on where you were the night before and where you were the night before and the way the winds were blowing yesterday and you know the temperature and this and that and you know so he was he was actually really good at keeping track of stuff so when he wrote um something about young native girls um like especially look out for the nines and tens and i'm pretty sure back in the day they didn't rate girls on a scale of one to ten like they do now so nines and tens to me pretty much translates to disgusting pedophilia and it's horrific because these people were living here they were already here and when columbus and his people showed up they were kind you know they they welcomed them in they taught them how to farm they they taught them what to do and they brought them in and they welcomed them and they just turned around and made them slaves and it's it's always been a thing to make people with darker skinned slaves i mean even like but back in the day slavery was like a thing that people did it's just true europeans enslaved europeans africans enslaved africans people traveled and enslaved other people it's horrible but it was something that was common so in a way you got to look at columbus and be like this is something that he was around but at the other same times de soto was speaking out all the time about how slavery was wrong and slavery was an abomination and columbus was an abomination for having slaves but we walk around and we uphold columbus as this pioneer who discovered our country what he did i mean they brought diseases over to these people who had lived off the land and lived naturally and had spiritual connections with the earth and the animals and like part of me thinks that's like so gross like these dirty diseased nasty i'm not a hater on white people but like these gross like crusty white people like came over and like infected everybody that that says something about what like their health like it says something about like you like ew like what hygiene they had that's just so disgusting to me and like we adopted some of native american culture for sure but also we demolished it and there are still true native americans living here on reservations and they're still getting treated like [ __ ] and it sucks and i wonder what i can do to stop it other than just educate people um but i know columbus would chop people's hands off native americans he would it wasn't just he enslaved them and then if they disobeyed he killed them like he would torture them he would cut their noses and ears off if they disobeyed or they didn't do something right to send messages to their tribes take their women rape them sell them to other people and there's so many different tribes i mean he just swept the land and just killed literally millions of people so that means like over a couple years so like that's literally like hundreds of people dying a day right or is that thousands of people dying a day because the other thing is he took them from a natural like a natural place like a natural diet their lifestyle and he would like hold them up and like put them on boats and ships and he like would bring them back to england and they would they would starve and they'd go into malnutrition and they'd develop really bad health and they would get these diseases at these nasty gross dirty europeans had so it's really a whole mess so my point is if you're and this is true these are what now this i'm reading lies my teacher told me by [ __ ] i'll put it in there it's by someone and this is a really educational book um because this guy is a history professor and he actually read a total of the first edition he read 12 different history textbooks for i guess high schoolers um and he compared it to real history and only a few of them you know even mentioned that columbus had slaves um and it's like these history companies are supposed to tell you that the real history and they don't and you have to question why do they choose to leave out the truth why they write history like it's a like it's a book like like oh it's tough but you always know there's gonna be a good end like that's just not how it was history you have to and they also don't teach critical thinking so the questions that they ask at the end of the chapter are like why did columbus go on his expedition but they should be questions like like what like what urged columbus to go on his expeditions like why like do you think these were right like do you really think that he made it to a minute like i don't know but like they should be more critical thinking questions that challenge the students to question history and put their own opinions on it instead of just answering like where did he go who did he what did he see like all these questions that you just flipped to a page and see um there should be critical thinking questions so my point is my point [ __ ] is if they are lying to you about who founded this country and the the most basic facts of this country did the cat get out it's a rat how did the rack get out outdoors come here bobby if they can [ __ ] lie to you about how this country was founded and the kind of people that claimed this land that's the very beginning if it starts on a lie what stops them from continuing to lie because the problem is these past couple years we've been catching them in lie after lie after lie sex trafficking rings collusions with china joe biden and his son while he was vice president inviting the chinese consulate to the pentagon and to like little rooms in the white house at midnight look that up why you know what why lie if you're not doing anything wrong why lie why like that's a great example if you're not doing anything wrong then why not be open why didn't trump show us his tax records because me i'd be like yeah look at them even if i was five i'd be like yeah i [ __ ] up i lied you could get out of it you're trump my other question is why didn't obama show us his birth certificate and people claim like that's like racist so he shouldn't have to okay but there are claims that he wasn't born here which i don't care about i think you know he's he's a demon but all presidents are awful people it's all planned they're all part of the thing actually a lot of presidents aren't even invited to the bilderberg group meetings um which says a lot about where the power really lies because it's a place where decisions are made are made for the world the us president is supposed to be the most powerful person in the world he doesn't even get invited i know bill clinton wasn't bill clinton's a [ __ ] brainwashed puppy it's all hillary seriously it's all hillary straight up these aren't just conspiracy theories i'm serious look at this rat hey baby don't do that don't do that don't do that you're gonna you're gonna fall here so that's where i'm at um yeah i'm currently handling i'm currently handling the distro i think that's all i wanted to say a minute ago ,3
7,rUwuOGG1YNU,"love your pike hey guys but here just gonna get a little moment for people to jump on haven't done this evening life for a while how's everyone doing people jumping on hello everybody let's talk about few updates people have some questions we can answer the questions if you guys want to make it interactive definitely ask the questions I'll do my best to answer what I can are some people jumping on happy Monday everybody till Monday alright so what's in the news well in the news first of all I was actually just getting off on the phone with my dear friend Letitia so I'm sure a lot of people know Letitia now if you didn't know before this lady's amazing she's being coming to our protest every single time with her son I think he's like five or six and and she's amazing woman you know very good hard very well-spoken always willing to contribute and yes I mean she went to the hospital st. Joseph wanted to get medical help and she was escorted out and denied service because she didn't wanna put a mask on and again like you're not supposed to put a mask if you don't want to like even the nurses if you guys didn't know actually there was a bunch of hospitals that got sued by the nurses that didn't want to take flu shots anymore and they said we're not gonna wear the masks and I think that happened in 2018 whoever can find an article put her in the comments if he can guys but Toronto hospitals eternally got sued by nurses that said enough is enough but I want to take any more flu shots because we're making me sick and I'm not gonna wear any masks and they want so that just goes to show you guys that you don't need to wear the mask unless somebody extremely immunocompromised that's only when that personal nurse around that person should wear the mask so Leticia was all right to say that she doesn't want to wear the mask and unfortunately she was denied service but guess what now she's known around the world it's like three million using Twitter there are articles from UK and obviously all our media and she just told me she's getting some interviews tomorrow so you know we'll look at as a positive we're definitely getting some exposure and that's great she got the attention of Ben Stiller probably another yeah unfortunately a lot of things are gonna come out soon are we waiting to see what's coming out from Hollywood and all the other celebrities but let's talk about masks masks is definitely a sensitive and timely issue right now to discuss tomorrow officially in Toronto municipalities and other places masks will be mandatory in all the inside places however there is an exception and that's what something you guys need to know there's always exceptions to know your rights if you have any medical condition you shouldn't be wearing that stuff and in fact you're not even supposed to be asked what's your medical condition you don't need to show the proof of anything let me just read you this I actually shared it on my profile if you just scroll down it's vital like this so it says exemptions are allowed and you don't need to bring proof of your exemption so this is from Toronto covered 19 mandatory mask by law I shared it on my thing you want to save it on your phone save it on your phone so that's something about that this is from one of the lobe loss ads that they post it and the Florida doesn't say any exemptions unfortunately but in the description it talks about vision exemptions so ideally the exemption should be put on a flyer so when I actually send a comment to them they actually replied said yes there's an exemption and the caption but I wish they put it on national fire but at least they were able to reply in the polite so long story short guys cos of Massacre and sheep yeah unfortunately the reality is the mask doesn't protect you there's a good video that I'll share link into the caption for this video after where the I thing is in Chile the firefighter basically used a cloth mask and he sprayed any type of aerosol through it and everything goes for the mask and please understand when they tell you that you can put anything on your face just cover your face put anything on your face it has nothing to do with your safety if it actually had to do something with your safety yes would be strict regulations on what kind of mask is supposed to wear but they literally telling you don't worry about what are you putting on your face just put something on your face just put stuff on your face and you know what as long as you want to be obedient and submissive well that's what you're gonna do and the whole saying that they even today I was watching Toronto briefing the villa was saying you know I wear the mask for you you wear a mask for me well guess what next thing will be I do contact tracing for you you do contact tracing for me and then they're gonna say I take a vaccine for you please take a vaccine for me this is exactly what we do it's the framework that's been done brainwashed and and and people get accustomed to it and it's ridiculous what you're doing so tomorrow this is our flyer I shared we launched in our truth education campaign a nationwide tomorrow will be I'll start in Toronto bite my vision for obviously this to be nationwide hugs over mask dot see a true education campaign I really believe that people lack information people like the truth people definitely confused the government spend I think at the federal level eighty eight million dollars for propaganda they specifically said eighty eight million dollars we're gonna spend on a campaigns to promote Corbett measures in other words on brainwashing people they spending this much money it's total waste of money for the virus that's similar to a flu again we have all the data now it's not a surprise anymore thank ya the shorts are coming all been on some months thank you Marcela we know now the data this is really comparable to regular flu if even that most of the deaths happen in long-term care homes because those people were never properly protected and actually infected people were put from the hospitals into the long-term care home so they can infect everybody else it's been shown now that infection only happens in closed environments there is no transmission that happens outside it's shown now and still the experts are not willing to talk about we're not willing to admit to it and they still saying that they did everything right and when the right truck and we were supposed to flatten the curve and blah blah blah and it's only for the first two weeks this is exactly what we told you we only gonna do it for two weeks we only gonna do it for two weeks three months later not much change the only going to wear the mask it's not gonna be mandatory now the masks are mandatory now be telling me the contact tracing is not mandatory well it will be mandatory the obviously trying to pass the vaccines it's not mandatory yet stay tuned it's coming it's really close but they don't so the masks has no protection except limited oxygen intake as well as a co2 level there's a really good video from Delhi where he actually used help of his son to measure the level of co2 and oxygen by his son wearing masks and facials etc I can post link to that too it shows real danger to to the especially child development yeah so like the death rate by CDC is 0.2 that's the death rate for this virus and by the way the death rate from the flu shot is 0.6 0.7 so a death rate from a from a flu shot it's three times more than from this virus and that's considered to be acceptable now this virus is unacceptable we've gotta shut down the whole economy we've gotta close everybody off everybody has to wear the mask now guys the everyone has to wear masks three months later after the whole thing happened I really like the same it's like you gotta wear a condom at the baby shower that's pretty much what they're trying to do to everybody now Oh what else we're gonna talk about oh yeah I can play you something really cool so we have a protest tomorrow like I said at Dundas Square we're launching this campaign nationwide truth education campaign we're gonna be distributing the Flyers that we'll be distributing for a while now it's double-sided flyer it has mask exemption at provincial level so all the provinces can use it even though it's municipal level right now with the Trenton mandate but again it's something that people can use as a tool to help them offset combating with the mask stuff right and the other side of the flyer actually has six specific things how masks are harmful for wearing in public right so they actually know about us that we're coming that even on on the radio today am twenty ten ten whatever it's called I guess story our mayor Ettore was called in to get his opinion on on the protests that we're gonna do tomorrow and I can play you what Tory said about our protests of Lincoln here as well I gathered the TV C's policy which I support is not to deny anybody ride on the streetcar and so they'll do that and have a ride on the streetcar and have a protest we got some news coverage and I presume that'll make them happy did everybody hear that apparently John Tory endorsed our protest tomorrow thank you guys so yeah whoever whoever's in Toronto tomorrow Dundas Square 9:30 calm we're gonna be distributing the flowers we're gonna have a team of people with signs distributing the flower is engaging the crowd and this is what I think we're gonna be definitely focusing more going forward we'll see how tomorrow goes I'm very excited looking forward to it but the whole idea is to engage the crowd to do what's called the community outreach public outreach right so we'll have designated people who are well-spoken who are positive who's excited to be there to talk with people people will be distributing the Flyers separately other people will be holding a sign so we have real teams coming tomorrow to down the square in intersection and engaging with people and and and really empowering people with information so what I was saying is that I believe people lack information people like the truth so that's what are we envisioning now for Hogzilla mosque initiative is to be true feed occation platform truth education campaign nationwide and I believe as long as we empower people with right information we empower people with truth with real data to combat the brainwashing that has been done by the government people hopefully will be started waking up we say this all the time at our rallies that truth only needs to be set one time and it's gonna resonate it's gonna plant the seed of doubt for people to at least question what the media's been telling them I've been saying this from the very beginning all the fear propaganda that we're doing in Canada and especially in the United States will always spike of new cases and bla bla bla again it does not matter how many new cases because first of all the tests themselves are false positive almost half of the time it's been proven has been shown that the tests themselves when they do it it's false positive so right away you gotta cut those numbers in half but let's put it down on the side let's say for the argument's sake you know you have a thousand people that tested positive for this virus 99 percent are mild cases 96 percent of mild cases so now it's not a thousand people that all so severely sick with this virus they can't even get off the bat and they need ventilators and whatever else which by the way is the wrong procedure we're not gonna talk about this right now the point is it's only 5% if people needs to go to the hospital because of that data be conditioned they have from this virus everybody else is fine everybody else just take the vitamin C and whatever else you do for immune system and just drink water you know enjoy B sunshine go outside exercise and you're gonna feel better like in any other flu season and again the flu season should be done long time ago that's why guess what today in Ontario we have zero cases for zero people died or whatever like it's it's like nothing's going on in Toronto I think it was zero cases sorry guys I didn't get my numbers right today but the point is there is no virus that's really spreading people are not affected by this anymore we in the heatwave this virus only can survive in stable closed environment anything above 20 degrees and and in humidity and outside in public there's no transmission zero and again today world health organization I think it was from today I don't think it was a previous video where she says specifically there are studies that show that asymptomatic people okay healthy people don't transmit this virus and again our own Hospital sick his hospital one of the best hospitals in the whole country came out with a report on June 17th which said specifically children are not super spreaders as was assumed before comparable to a flu our own hospital set down so why on earth the playgrounds are still closed there's still limits on on kids playing together in soccer fields and whatever kids should be outside right now playing soccer playing baseball playing basketball and enjoying life and being children and I posted the video the isolation technique is something that's been used by CEA as a what I call this as you know treating the the criminals or whatever the procedures to to get information out of them I lost much what is it called but it's the CIA technique has been used for a long time to submit people and and they using some people right now it's ridiculous any questions guys tomorrow whoever's in Toronto come get your flyers we'll have a lot of Flyers distributed plus you can come and grab as many as you want and distribute in your area the website is up and running we obviously putting new things on it but the flower section on the website right now you can download it I'll post a link to hugs of a mosque website as well the other thing that I'm really going to be focusing a lot with hugs of a mosque website is to create a platform to do communities all across the country because I completely understand that people feel lost people feel out of place when they are awake and everybody around them is wearing the mask and and keeping the distance and tell them this is the end of the world and what are you gonna do so I feel it's very important and vital for us to create sense of community with people and that's what I've been doing in my private child's just connecting a bunch of random people and people feel like yes I actually belong somewhere I'm not mad like there are other people like myself that that mad at the situation but they're not crazy so we're going to be focusing a lot on that and out of that we're going to build teams of outreach of what we're gonna be able to do in tomorrow in Toronto by I envision this happening in all the cities across this country we have teams of people it doesn't have to be a large group you know 10 15 20 people at Marc's going to a busy intersection in the city and distributing the Flyers with signs and engaging the people and talking to people and being polite and being understanding that people are just scare people confuse but here's some information that sheds the light that the measures of the government not protecting the people the measures of the government actually killing people I will repeat this is very serious that people need to understand everything that government been doing for the last few months have not saved the lives it actually caused death console surgeries in Ontario alone we've been saying this as soon as this emergency order wanted an effect they immediately be cancelled 52 necessary medical procedures those are serious procedures that people were scheduled for a long time ahead and every week been in this emergency order 12,000 new medical procedures necessary procedures was added to this so now 3 months later what is this 12 weeks by 12 so that's like another 150 so we're talking about over to almost probably two hundred thousand necessary medical procedures will cancel now guess what besides talking about how many new cases every day now expert in Ontario at least even once talked how many people died from drug overdose how many people died from suicide how many people actually died from Miss surgeries there was only one conversation happen I guess I think at this point almost two months ago where they said possibly 36 people died because they missed heart procedure surgeries and that's only was one time why why there's no more talk about this I'm sure there's a lot more people are dying cancer screening been canceled cancer surgeries cancel like it's ridiculous what we're doing I only heard from British Columbia one time in May we talked in the whole month of May in the whole province of British Columbia 56 people died from carbon now at the same time a hundred and seventy people die from drug overdose I'll repeat in one month in whole province of British Columbia I don't know how my how many people population in British Columbia if somebody can make in the comments let let us know but the again 56 people died from Corbett in the whole month of May and 170 people died from drug overdose so which pandemic are we talking about here do we have a real pandemic and we need to flatten the curve we've drug overdose deaths and suicide or is it really the coverage that we need to worry about and what about when we're talking about this pandemic I thought I said this before by guys to think about this and when you're talking to somebody just say it like that how possible it is to have an empty hospitals during real pandemic think about this if it was a real pandemic with real disease outbreaks etc the hospitals would be overflown it would be no space at all and it's not because it's not a real pandemic and at the same time when they talk about emergency order emergency is something that happens suddenly unexpectedly and only lasts a very short time so why again on earth are we in these three months later and now we're going to mandate masks for everyone to wear which is completely ridiculous it completely infringes on my right on my ability to breathe and on children like it's a child abuse which is sanctioned by the government right now where children are forced to wear masks above two years old what the hell is that again children are not risk at all zero zero people died from this virus below 19 years old why on earth children have to wear masks it makes no sense unless you understand their real agenda behind to actually make people sick to actually make people immune system suppressed like and and people are willing to do this from this from from something that survival rate 99.8% what happened to everybody like you have more chances dying in a car crash then dying from this virus please understand now I've been a health and wellness coach for the last 20 years I always educate people about three major mortality causes are heart disease cancer and Stroke those are the three major main causes of death around the world heart disease cancer and Stroke millions of people die from those things every single day every single year and I will flatten in the curve of the dct that actually causes those three main things no we're not in fact we actually increase in obesity right now because people are not allowed to go to the gym the gym too close people not even allowed to work out are in the park people supposed to make cherry cheesecake like dog fourth promotes I guess everyone should look like dog for it right that's considered to be healthy enough disgusting any questions guys any questions yeah so tomorrow 9:30 Dundas Square bunch of us are coming together see if there's any other questions otherwise we'll be obviously at the Queens Park on Saturday like we always are we've been there for three months nobody's sick everybody's healthy everybody's having a good time we have a digit now we have a little bit of a dance party then we'll do the speeches then people do the March and and then we usually have enough to party somebody wants to come to the beach after that as well but we just enjoy life and you know last week a lot of people went to the lake and stuff like that and it's great I want people to enjoy life there was a big article I think was it on the weekend our Friday something like that oh I can't remember maybe for Canada Day people went to a saga beach and all these people talking about this is like the worst human behavior ever what are you talking about people just enjoying life people want to go to the beach and have a good time like what are you talking about and then everyone's just like yeah yeah nobody should go to the beach ridiculous just again please understand this was the easiest experiment the government whoever behind did ever did on humanity that for something that's death rate it's not even a boy like this is not Zika this is not a bowler this is comparable to regular flu and everybody's willing to just give up all the rights and the people feel virtuous and people feel righteous by following  rules and just to be part of the masses like people need to wake up and stand the ground and almost people unfortunately that I know personally all this amazing speakers and leadership training and all that stuff like you showing your true colors whoever's with the masks outside right now what kind of leadership training exactly have you done that you're willing to give up all your rights not stand the ground and actually look at the research and understand that you're not protecting anyone with that stupid thing on your face piece of cloth it has zero protection time yay any questions guys so yeah so hugs over mask t-shirts guys if you want to get a t-shirt message me we're using the money for the Flyers for the website or anything else but we need definitely support the cause whoever's coming tomorrow if you do have a short please come with the shirt so we all kind of brand it right and message me if you want to get your shirt I'll be in a few tomorrow whoever needs one and yeah let you know if there's any other questions the website is up and running obviously gonna be putting a lot more things into it but I'm glad the website is up today I want to thank a lie that's been putting a lot of work behind the scenes we have a few volunteers that are doing a lot of work always good to have people coming together and working for the cause or the benefit everybody else I'll post a link of this video we'll have bunch of links that I talked about the the Delhi wired video about the mask with his son I will have a link to to the website to download your flyer it'll have a link also but soon the same side you can fill out the form to become a volunteer and contribute in any way you can to this platform but again the vision is empower people with right information and power people with truth and education to combat the brainwashing that the government's been doing very heavily for the last three and a half months so we definitely gonna resist we're gonna fight for rights if our children's rights and enough is enough how does a mask Bobby all guys stay healthy ",2

9,jweMwOpX_6I,when they first started thinking about ways to produce vaccines they were going to take cancer cells the cdc had discussions about this but they were concerned because although cancer cells are perfect they can produce an infinite supply of vaccine antigen because they're immortal they just keep reproducing it's rather disgusting and gross right but they were concerned because they thought there could be a what they call oncogenic factor in there it's cancer so maybe if you grew these vaccines out of cancer cells it could cause cancer so they're you know what we're not going to use human cancer cells we're going to use animal cells instead and so they chose not to use cancer cells from animals but regular animal cells thinking oh well this is safer they didn't know at the time that there was this thing called reverse transcriptase which is an enzyme that can take genetic information from another species and put it into the genome of a species like a human and so only after they developed all these vaccines from the animals did they realize that hidden within this vaccine seed stock were all these viruses that that they didn't know and so then they put them into the bodies literally of millions of people s simeon virus 40 with oral polio vaccines was the first example even morris hilleman acknowledged that they were causing cancers but and this is documented but this is just the tip of the iceberg there is reverse transcriptase activity in mmr vaccines recognized since 1994. what do you mean by reverse transcriptase is an enzyme that only retroviruses have and retrovir and so what it does is it reverse transcribes writes backwards are the genome which is rna into dna and then it's inserts itself into your dna and stays there for your lifetime and for generations after that so reverse transcriptase is a hallmark of the presence of a retrovirus so in 1994 our government the uk government the who the world health organization everybody accepted and and talked about and discussed in institutional medicine meetings the presence of reverse transcriptase in the mmr vaccine and whether or not it posed a threat well fast forward to 2011 our work and then the ramifications of our work said absolutely it makes a difference and absolutely it makes a difference absolutely it's there and oh my god it was the big oh my god moment in our book in plague where we presented these data and they basically said we we can't stop this they're everywhere they're in our lab workers they're in our doctors they're our nurses we introduced unwittingly and unknowingly into the human population a new family of retroviruses that has long been associated with cancers leukemia lymphoma neuroimmune disease including alzheimer's parkinson's and and such and so we're looking at the very explosion of these diseases in our world today when the government realized how big it was it was will we tell the truth will we say we introduced it by a contaminated blood supply or contaminated vaccines no we won't we'll just make sure judy mykovitz and frank rossetti go away forever and that nobody ever believes the word they said and that this work is all fraud but the one little problem they had was i wouldn't sign that piece of paper i wouldn't agree i wouldn't say it the data support it will continue talking about the data and and and neither would dr rossetti they tried to basically get us to refute our data deny our data throw away or destroy our original data showing the infected families and populations and um and we refused and and when we refused we were fired ,3
10,vXRqZoFwKpk,is repugnant in a free and open society and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies the secret oaths and the secret proceedings we decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it even today there is little value in opposing the thread of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions even today there is little value in ensuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it and there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment that i do not intend to permit to the extent that it's in my control and no official of my administration whether his rank is high or low civilian or military should interpret my words here tonight as an excuse to censor the news to stifle dissent to cover up our mistakes or to withhold from the press and the public the facts they deserve to know for we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covet means for expanding its sphere of influence on infiltration instead of invasion on subversion instead of elections on intimidation instead of free choice on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day it is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit highly efficient machine that combines military diplomatic intelligence economic scientific and political operations its preparations are concealed not published its mistakes are buried not headlined its dissenters are silenced not praised no expenditure is questioned no rumor is printed no secret is revealed no president should fear public scrutiny of his program for from that scrutiny comes understanding and from that understanding comes support or opposition and both are necessary i am not asking your newspapers to support an administration but i am asking your help in the tremendous task of informing and alerting the american people for i have complete confidence and the response and dedication of our citizens whenever they are fully involved i not only could not stifle controversy among your readers i welcome him this administration intends to be candid about its errors or as a wise man once said an error doesn't become a mistake until you refuse to correct it we intend to accept full responsibility for our errors and we expect you to point them out when we miss them without debate without criticism no administration and no country can succeed and no republic can survive that is why the athenian lawmaker stolen decreated a crime for any citizen to shrink from controversy and that is why our crash was protected by the first amendment the only business in america specifically protected by the constitution not primarily to amuse and entertain not to emphasize the trivial and the sentimental not to simply give the public what it wants but to inform to arouse to reflect to state our dangers and our opportunities to indicate our crises and our choices to lead mold educate and sometimes even anger public opinion this means greater coverage and analysis of international news for it is no longer far away and foreign but close at hand and local it means greater attention to improved understanding of the news as well as improved transmission and it means finally the government at all levels must meet its obligation to provide you with the fullest possible information outside the narrowest limits of national security and so it is to the printing press to the recorder of man's deeds the keeper of his conscience the courier of his news that we look for strength and assistance confident that with your help man will be what he was born to be free and independent okay folks uh before we go on to uh taking a look at what i feel happened to uh john f kennedy and the real reason why that he's dead i want to examine uh sorry about that i want to examine very closely the rifle that they said that killed the john kennedy and they proclaim that this gun was uh bought by lee harvey oswald and uh they say that he ordered it through the mail and picked it up i think through sears or something which back in those days you could do guns that way even back in the early 80s around 1980 and stuff you can order guns through the mail you can't do that now you've not been able to do that for some years but back in those days you could now this 6.5 by 52 carcano uh this was an italian gun and if you really don't know what to look at you can really get a lot of misconceptions about this rifle now in the days that we live in uh this gun can easily be confused with the 6.5 swede it can easily be confused with the 6.5 grendel and it can easily be confused with the 6.5 that you can actually buy today and how it's loaded versus how it was loaded back in those days and what was available to the public now there's probably not too many of you know this but back in those days even the the ammunition that was made around 1940 1941 that was not available to the public at that time what they had made available to the public and had released was ammunition that was no longer currently being used by any military and that's why they release it to the public because it's not and that was the old world war one ammunition okay that was used back in world war one because this gun was first devised back in the 1800s see look at this right here it'll tell you that this gun was actually devised see here 1891 1888 to 1891 was when it was first devised and from that point up until world war one was the ammunition that oswald would have had available to him okay so given the fact that we know that that would have to be the ammunition that you would have to take a look at and say is what they say feasible in comparison to what it did and uh i'm just going to tell you me and a friend of mine back when i was around 19 20 years old his name was michael and he is a ballistics expert he really is about the best that i know if anybody from back home is watching this they're going to know who that is but i'm not going to say his last name but his name was michael and he he he's a he's a gun craze man he's been that way his whole life reloading and ballistics and this and that and it just goes on and on but we took some of the ammunition that would have been available to oswald and we went and we conducted some ballistic tests for how far that they said the motorcade was in dallas versus how far they said that this shot was fired with the 6.5 52 car 52 carcano a model 91 italian and uh at that time stuff like this was not available this is new stuff the only thing that would have been available to him would have been old world war one ammunition now how many do you of you know that uh the the the powder back in those days folks the same amount of powder that would have filled this cartridge up to a given amount of length up into the back of the the the bullet would not have produced a compression that world war ii ammunition would have let alone ammunition of today it was slow burning powder it was somewhere between what they used in the old west days and what they used in world war ii and you couldn't get the kind of compression out of that type of ammunition that you could the world war ii ammunition or especially ammunition of today now the way they've got that gun set up today it's a force to be reckoned with but then again they've done everything that way folks used to a 30 30 winchester didn't have much to it and now you can buy that lever revolution ammunition for horndy and it's completely revolutionized to 30 30 winchester now all of a sudden you've got something that would have dropped 11 inches at 100 yards and all of a sudden it's dropping one inch or 200 yards you know that's the difference or 250 yards with a 30 30. so that's the difference but if you're going to take a look at reality when it comes to this what you have to do is you have to take a look realistically at what was available at that time that oswald could have got his hands on to have done this with and so the uh the test that we conducted was that type of ammunition old world war one ammunition that he was able to get a hold of online specifically and folks i'm going to tell you something the conclusion that we came to between he he and i both and especially him which i respected his opinion he knows more about this than i do he said jerry there's absolutely no way whatsoever that that old world war one round that had that slow burning powder in it that was corrosive had corrosive primers in it could have ever done that kind of damage to john f kennedy's head at that at that at that length you had to have a certain amount of pressure folks to equal out that kind of damage because this round blowed his head off literally folks it didn't just enter in and kill him it literally blowed his head off it blowed he'll blow pieces of his brains man onto his wife it blow pieces of his brains out in the streets at the 300 some yards that it was supposed to have done this at the world war one ammunition that would have been available to oswald to do this there's no way that it had that much knockdown power at that amount at that distance to equal up to the damage that was done to his head absolutely no way no way whatsoever folks and so that's the big misconception about today when it comes to this is uh people are looking at this round and they're like well you know it shoots pretty hard or you know this 6.5 grendel they made it shoots hard or this 6.5 italian that was replaced that that shoots hard or this new ammunition that comes out that this 6.5 52 carcano it shoots oh well it all does and it probably all is sort of in the realm of being capable of doing what happened to john kennedy but that's not reality folks the reality of the entire situation is this what he could get a hold of at that time and what he shot supposedly john kennedy with is what you have to realistically go by and what he realistically got a hold of was not capable of doing what it did that bullet went all the way down guys to very low foot pounds at that distance i mean it was lucky to uh i don't know it would have been lucky it would have went through one side of a barrel maybe i'm serious it was just literally just flying at that time it lost all the pressure it had after 125 yards and that's all he had available to him because when they real when they release this military ammunition to the public the reason why they're doing that is they're no longer using it and it's it's just warehouse stock at that point in time and the only thing they had declared the uh with the carcano is not usable at that time was the slow burning powder from the 1800s to world war one so that's all oswald could have got a hold of so there's no way whatsoever that he killed john kennedy with this gun at the length that they said that he did because it could not have created that kind of damage now you're going to say jerry who who did kill him well it really doesn't matter folks the bottom line is he's dead so why does it matter how many shooters they were or whatever the bottom line is he's dead okay i think there was multiple shooters but to sit and and conjure all night is really to get away from the uh realistically the true matter behind why that he was killed and that's more important than how many shooters there were bottom line is guys he's in the grave it doesn't matter if it was two shooters or five shooters what matters is who did it and that's what we're going to examine right here okay hang on you know what folks this just goes to show you all the more just how how uh dishonest that the internet is anymore you can't go by anything the internet has to say anymore it's not the liars anyway your federal reserve banknote is made in switzerland and you you can't get this thing here to tell you that at all harley anymore um it's the rockefellers the rothschilds the warburgs the ships uh jp morgan merrill lynch those are the ones he folks that owns the federal reserve bank now take a look at this it says the federal reserve european central bank and swiss national bank announces expansion it that what do you mean the swiss bank in the federal reserve bank is the same thing see the liars man your your reality has been altered folks look at this swiss 100 being to be installed in climate push but anyway your money's being printed in switzerland and it has been for years okay the federal reserve banknote has nothing whatsoever to do with the federal government in the united states of america it's the bankers of the swiss folks that does this okay that's who prints your money and when they tell you that we're in debt x number of dollars to the federal reserve bank like 307 billion billion trillion dollars or whatever they say this is the people that they say we're in debt to you know same people uh giving you your coven shot right now too okay and i don't know how many of you know this but let's see why are switzerland's foreign assets so low the growing financial exposure of small open economy the federal reserve bank of new york the federal reserve bank is not owned by new york the federal reserve bank is owned by the swiss of switzerland you see how it lies people liars but anyway uh one thing you didn't hear john f kennedy say is not only did he uh denounce the secret societies but he also made a speech and it's been erased everywhere i can't find it anywhere at all but it happened that he said he was going to take the money that we are spending here in the united states and he was going to take it and do away with a foreign country supplying us with that money and we were going to start printing our own money here in the united states okay that's what he said and the money was being printed in switzerland folks and so now uh you're getting closer to the truth and i'm telling you the truth hang on look at this folks i put enough information in i forced it to tell the truth and it wouldn't do it a minute ago look the u.s federal reserve is a privately owned controlled bank by the rothschilds the rockefellers the morgans and prince money by the us government hang on our one moment okay i had to keep this going but there you go folks rothschilds rockefellers the morgans imprints money for the u.s government the true power of the rothschilds goes far beyond the banking empire they are also behind all wars since napoleon i finally forced it through enough information being in there that it was either going to flat out lie to me but guess what folks if i didn't know what to punch in there they never would have told me that okay does the rothschild family control the world money supply here is the truth yeah yeah you ought to look into that one folks there's a place to go to to look at that uh idapod.com rothschildfamily.com company is a good place to go to for that but see it won't tell me this unless i knew what to punch in i already knew it all right hang on there you know what folks it doesn't matter what anybody says or what organizations was involved which all of them are pretty much involved in corruption of this bunch you could say well jerry that uh some of the government had him killed or russia had him killed number one russia had nothing to do with this whatsoever just like osama bin laden didn't have anything to do with 911. he these are the same people that done your 911 that killed john f kennedy same people i promise you it is all controlled by england the crown the rothschilds and rockefellers of switzerland uh which by the way run your government if you think you're free and you think you're electing presidents yeah you've you put yourself in a world of delusions what you put yourself into you you put yourself into the matrix for the sheep because it's never been that way folks every american president that you ever had has been a member of these people so you really think you elected them and every one of those presidents has had blood lineages to a royal king of some kind i guess that's just an accident isn't it telling you the truth guys my grandmother used to hang a uh picture up on her wall of john f kennedy she was really fond of him and folks i will tell you something if it came right down to it i would have to say that that's probably the only president that we had that i would do the same for because the rest of them have all been tricksters deceivers i don't care how charismatic their speeches were i don't they they all belong to this and ultimately this is what has controlled your country and ultimately this is the reason why that john f kennedy got killed because he wanted to do away with the secret societies and he wanted to do away with the federal reserve banknote in switzerland and move it back here to the united states and so now you know thank you for watching my video folks ,2
11,k3RR7-64zfM,people often ask me what does it matter what shape the earth is does it affect my day-to-day life in any way after all i still have to go to work pay my bills etc etc and of course while all that is still true i always point out to them that we all perceive that the earth is flat and motionless it's what we as children inherently knew even though we may not have definitively defined it as such but then along came these authorities who told us that it's otherwise and not just vaguely different than what we perceive but so drastically different than that which our empirical senses so consistently informed us people argue i'm not a pilot or a navigator i don't fly planes or navigate ships i don't send rockets out into space i'm not an astronaut or a space farer or even an engineer for that matter it doesn't matter to me whether the earth is flat or a globe a triangle or a cube to which my response is but you still observe a flat and motionless plane no matter where you go to measure or observe it think about it if our teachers could lie to us and go so far as to convince us all of this stark falsehood can you imagine what else might be a lie what other deceptions have we as a species swallowed wholesale simply because an authority figure has proclaimed it to us matter of factly and not even the scientists and investigators themselves but merely talking heads blindly parroting the lies to us [Music] but then i realized that this is the very reason people cannot accept it because once they acknowledge that they have been deceived on such a fundamental level regarding such a blatantly obvious fact they would be forced to re-examine their entire lives and renounce the unquestioning faith they've invested in submitting to the establishment i don't blame them the truth is blindingly bright when you've spent your entire life asleep those of us who have chosen to seek out truth mustn't condescend them criticizing them for wanting to continue on in ignorance afraid that their well-maintained bubble of trust is about to burst we must be empathetic considering truth that may lay ahead of ourselves which we may not be willing to face up to when you first find truth you will be troubled but if you are troubled you will then be amazed of course the rabbit hole goes far deeper than flat earth that's just the first rung of the ladder so keep on seeking out the truth and do not cease seeking until you find for you will know the truth and the truth will liberate you you ,3
12,4pq5Bq2DdUg,first let me give you a little bit of background on who i am i'm dr. Nick Begich I'm a author and lecturer I have a doctorate in traditional and complementary medicines I was born and raised and spent most of my life here in Alaska I also work as the executive director for the lay institute on technologies based in dallas texas its main mission is to educate the public on the impacts and repercussions of technology so that we can be prepared in this century the first topic today that we want to cover is updates on the harp story the high frequency active auroral research project which many people are familiar with this this project additionally was a joint effort of the Air Force and Navy to build large radio transmitters here in Alaska these transmitters would occupy a huge area initially it was 48 antenna in the array these are antennas that are 72 feet tall have a cross daya pole so across the top you'll see this type of a shape these are about 70 feet across there's 48 in the array eventually at the end of this coming summer summer of 2005 we'll be seeing a hundred and eighty antenna in the array and eventually the full array will be 360 antenna the idea between these radio frequency generators is to focus radio frequency energy in a much different way than than most of us think about radio frequency energy coming off of an antenna if we think of it at all but when you think about it when you go back to the original companies that started this project it was a company called Arco Power Technologies Inc which was a subsidiary of atlantic richfield on the largest oil and gas companies at that time operating in alaska they sold that subsidiary to e systems which is a military contractor a large military contractor based in washington DC who later sold it to raytheon who later sold it to a British Aerospace which now controls that technology but in the course of that one of the things that they had talked about was what's called Earth penetrating tomography this is the idea of sending a signal up into the ionosphere I oscillating that signal off the ionosphere which actually causes that 30 miles above the Earth's surface to begin to vibrate in harmony with a signal on the ground causing it to act as a giant broadcast antenna sending that signal back down to the earth and it passes through the earth and sea in the form of an e LF an extremely low frequency signal a very long wavelengths that efficiently passes through the earth and that can be used for a number of things including earth penetrating tomography the idea of looking into the earth or in plain language it would be like by comparison x-raying the earth they're looking into the earth for underground mineral layers underground shelters nuclear facilities and the like Brooks concern was much broader in terms of what could be triggered with earth penetrating tomography and one of the things that he noted was the effect of resonance this idea ascending energy in it harmonizes in a way that causes the energy actually to be more than the sum of the total you know it's like the old world war one stories where the armies were marching across wooden bridges in Europe and some hours after they had marched across the bridges would just collapse and it was the rhythmic beat of the march across that bridge that set up essentially a vibration that eventually collapsed the entire structure this idea of resonance when applied to earth penetrating tomography at very high power levels causes concern for many scientists including brooks agnew because what he believes is possible is to trigger events within the Earth's geophysical events earthquake volcanic eruptions the kinds of things that may already be on the edge of this charge and with the right resonant energies added into the system caused them to overload and actually fracture in fact it was William Cohen that actually made the statement regarding weapons of mass destruction and the idea of generating earthquakes artificially weapons of mass destruction and the idea of generating earthquakes artificially weapons of mass destruction and the idea of generating earthquakes artificially the blueprint for harp high frequency active auroral research program what does harp do HAARP is is a large antenna where we beam radio frequency energy up into the upper atmosphere and we create on a small scale what the Sun normally does the assignment came that the Navy and the Air Force were to manage the program there were some other ideas both to possibly modify weather in 1983 I did radio tomography with 30 watts looking for oil in the ground I found 26 oil wells over a nine state area and one hundred percent of the time was accurate which is 30 watts of power beaming straight into solid rock HAARP uses a billion Watts beamed straight into the ionosphere for experiments picture these strings on the piano as layers of the earth each one has its own frequency what we used to do is beam radio waves into the ground and it would vibrate any strings that were present in the ground we might get a sound back like and we'd say that's natural gas we might get a sound back like and we say that's crude oil we were able to identify each frequency we accomplish this with just 30 watts of radio power if you do this with a billion watts the vibrations are so violent that the entire piano would shake in fact the whole house would shake in fact the vibrations could be so severe underground that could even cause an earthquake it's being used to describe the earthquakes impact unimaginable mr. president I know you've been to Haiti a couple of times already as the UN Special Envoy you'll be going back oh sure yeah I'd be back there tonight if I think I'm doing more good here staying on the phone trying to help solve problems we've got we basically need now food water shelter and medical supplies we identified some places for large numbers of people to seek shelter today but if anyone wants to help now not two weeks from now a month from now we'll need lots of rebuilding help lots of volunteer help but now unless you're in a search-and-rescue team or a medical team the best thing you can do is give money for food water shelter and first aid supplies those are the things we need and we set up a website for the UN at clinton foundation org slash haiti earthquake you can text Haiti at 2022 it's into text message ten dollars will be forwarded to it will move that money in a hurry but everybody this is one of those things where five dollars can make a difference before ours then this could become a very different situation indeed we have seen before the capacity at the head capacity that Haiti has for violence in the 2004 coup in the 2008 food riots and it could slip towards that situation again becoming survival of the fittest you the American troops are arriving they may be needed to keep order on the streets as well as run the operations here at the airport I believe that we probably have 24 hours in which to get those supplies to the people who so desperately need them if it slips to 48 hours I would not want to be the person standing in the back of one of those trucks handing out the food supplies are handing out the water bottles that could become a very very dangerous situation indeed there is no doubt that at this hour we are facing a race against time to help the desperate people of port-au-prince when the Fox says the ravaged scream he comes and running but not to help ,2
13,5Jm7bZOFb0g,folks here we go at another video so stop the channel for the realness so this is gonna be this isn't even my beliefs I can't even say that I would like to say that that'd be more cold this isn't a fantasy so we're gonna talk about why I believe in flying cars and wireless things that's fine if you like wired things and you like cars that are on the ground they could have convert to the ground and go up to the sky and fly around just like the Jetsons the Jetsons are there just based if you ever know what the Jetsons are basically it's a futuristic thing where they all live high up in the sky and the chorus fly around basically you know like single single airplane manned vehicles which is I have another video suppression of Technology or your past was suppressed from you history they don't want you and I've said similar things all the things are out there especially when it comes to technology what they just don't want you to have it why do you think they come keep coming with new TVs they came they came made at TV which was already here of course black and white TV oh did they and then they invented color oh did they then they have multiple channels then a flat screen then a 3d TV if you haven't got the the thing here yet I'm gonna keep going they invented something like a steam locomotive then they ran it on coal and then they ran it on gas oh but they came up with the same vehicle and they keep coming up with the same concept every year why because all these companies run you they roll you they don't want to come out with anything new they want to keep giving you the same [ __ ] over and over and over again why wouldn't they cuz you're a slave to the system welcome aboard all the phones are already been here there's nothing [ __ ] new about on not at all nothing new nothing new I'll tell you what would be new if you put it on your wrist and it just project it on just project it on to the screen on to the wall it's already here they don't want you to have it of course we can go up and fly just one man vehicle fly around we have spaceships UFOs you know what size and cap capability unknown they're here we have them we man them we create them we were giving them we can fly around but they don't want us to fly around why would they want us to fly around where they can keep us on the [ __ ] ground all day not to say I don't really like air but if I was driving I really don't like water I don't like being on water that much not a water creature I'm a land creature that being said all technology has been suppressed from you and is being suppressed from you we are meant we could fly around easily it's not hard they just don't want you to fly around they want you to buy their gas this is all an energy thing same with food source everything's an energy thing all and this isn't me thinking out of the box it is but I've been knew this for a long time all all this this is this is a joke this is literally a joke right here the headphones any wired controllers anything that's wired is fundamentally Wireless to begin with it has to be it's all all energy is just there already they're just suppressing it from you and if you don't this isn't an argument this is factual empirical evidence it's there they know how to do all this they they slowly gives you the technology but they're not gonna let you have like the good stuff pretty much or the stuff that would make sense to have such as we could just fly in a one-man helicopter to wherever I go [ __ ] driving and we wouldn't have roads and that's why we we could have more nature don't get in this stuff people will crash in the sky okay let them crash people crash on the ground - if you're an idiot you're not gonna crash not to say you're an idiot though or anyone's an idiot that being said most people those people were sheep and don't want to leave into this stuff and all kind and don't have an open mind we could easily fly around airplanes spaceships they have all the technology they just don't want to give it to you they don't want you to have it okay they don't want you to have it your phones supposed to charge wirelessly okay you're wirelessly it is it's supposed to charge wirelessly don't give me no [ __ ] that it has the charge on a liar are you kidding me are you [ __ ] kidding me it's supposed to charge wirelessly what do you think Wi-Fi is what do you think satellite is oh this oh so so so wait you have a satellite up there that sends a signal down and it can track anybody they're always listening to your phone they listen to everybody everybody no matter what you do they're listening all your private conversations oh they love it they love they listen to everyone all the time especially if you do things they don't like they're definitely listening now of course when you when you have more power which is basically more of a following that I'm coming to understand more popularity they listen to you more who is who's there listening you know the other side the evil side that's not really the topic of this video though it's more so about technology in the technology that is you know their art I don't want you to they even have a belief system into like time-traveling fairies trolls from under the bridge all these things come from somewhere mermaids you know dragons course aliens okay people that live in the earth which ultimately they do where else would they live angels demons entities yada yada yada we talk about technology we could be flying around to wherever you have to go every day they want to control where you want to go every day they make borders they make walls they make this to control you guess what it's our time the [ __ ] speak out and do something about it I will lead since no one else not saying there's other people who don't but there takes a specific person to lead simple as that not to say other people haven't or haven't Ron they get taken down assassinated JFK MLK these people knew some things too and work and good things doctor baby all the activists fighting for the Amazon you know all the people fighting against corruption and evil plenty more people out there too of course we all know but we all know JFK was a big one and yeah so basically they got all this we they just don't want you that's why you had to pay and how you have to have a passport where you're [ __ ] free we can travel wherever the [ __ ] we want to travel you don't put a cap on that that's [ __ ] that's [ __ ] no one owns the land the land is to everybody not saying we're gonna go invade your house now if you're on the other side we might have to which they think the same thing about us and they're gonna recruit more of them it's us it's up to our generation or younger generation to stand up and fight back because no one else did it for us it's up to us we are gonna make the change don't let these people fool you we're all their disguises and deceiving technology and [ __ ] we should be allowed to travel where everyone we can fly wherever it's just [ __ ] it's just complete [ __ ] controlling our borders we're setting borders for countries oh this is this state and this is this which just may be some good for demographics but when you use it as oh this is a state boundary oh you can't go out of the country oh really if you have a felony you can't leave the country what you can't leave the country and we're gonna get in some other stuff about Antarctica and Greenland the places were not allowed to go oh we're not allowed to go to some places hmm really doesn't matter they control you and the way they control you one of the ways they control you one big way which people don't look at is how they explore they don't want you to explore they don't want you to see things this world's a lot bigger than you think there's more stuff to this world that they don't want you to know whether that's true or not which it is to some degree I truly believe that regardless this is not about beliefs at all this is suppression of Technology and they don't want you to have their wouldn't you control your borders they that's why there's gates that's why there's gates for boats that's why they don't want you to have this technology Oh for rich people of course but then they still want you to have a passport oh I need to vaccination to go to a certain island or you know whatever a shot a bunch of BS [ __ ] you so that's all it's a little short video boggle your mind it's time to stand up and stop being a [ __ ] fight for your right think outside the box it's not that hard really sit there stillness is everything you can learn everything for stillness you don't need to go anywhere you don't need no everybody quiet the mind and sit there still you'll get every answer you ever wanted have a nice day scribe ,2
14,dVxyeJ7pjSo,[Music] - gosh another conspiracy theory story for real there's nothing better going on I wasn't really into the last one Oh Stevie Wonder things they kind of offensive he's definitely blind I'm gonna assume John wrote this [ __ ] right okay hats up guys jinx here with the P and P update and today we're discussing discussing our Lavigne is she alive actually been dead for over a decade in which placed my body double while the evidence suggests she of course is alive we here at P and P believe it's our duty to ask the questions and other public needs to run away from so let's talk to our handsome award-winning on-the-scene reporter John W it was way cooler than G [ __ ] you John Wow thanks for the kind words Jencks and to answer your earlier question yes avril lavigne is dead she is so [ __ ] it guys i don't want to do this anymore please jinx i'm currently at a portuguese blogspot site that i found and the evidence here is overwhelming buckling guys because this one is about to get a little bit I know you can't even read portion it not aware of jinx but where we're going we don't need words what in three whole minutes that I've been here I've gathered that the Averell Ramona Levine we all know and love the same Avril Lavigne that would go on to marry Chad Kroeger to form the most powerful musical couple in the galaxy actually died in 2003 she was replaced with a body double to keep the hit machine rolling and no one batted an eye hit with the photo montage Chuck a new and evolving birthmark at variations in acne and other facial blemishes act and most telling differences in her complete facial structure Avril Don jinx she's long gone but all those pictures explain nothing I literally just googled it and BuzzFeed debunk the whole thing what are you talking about what about these arrows jinx and what about this that's literally just two pictures of Avril Lavigne from two different years John what the [ __ ] man exactly Avril Lavigne is a time-traveling reptilian shapeshifters named Melissa and that's a fact back to you jinx all hey later boy yes I mean you guys mom subscribe now before I go back to complex news it's [ __ ] is ,2
15,Co66qz-fcSY,hey everyone it's bree i'm back with another video i'm just going to give you all a quick update before i dive deep into the video we have some deep conversations to get into but before we get into it um i'm gonna give you all a quick update on my vaccine so i'm okay i got it in my over about two weeks ago actually yeah two weeks ago and i basically the only side effect i had was i was not hungry for about two weeks i had no appetite i basically had to force feed myself for two weeks but my appetite is back now so love that honestly we have some things to dive into okay and it's stuff that we may shy away from and that is reality reality uh we need to start embracing reality and live in it very successfully that is the goal here okay so i first want to bring up the idea of qr codes that are going to be used to prove to people that we have gotten our vaccine there are going to be many places that require us to get vaccinated to go inside of so i'm looking back i've been um you know i medicate with psilocybin that is my therapist and it has been the most beneficial therapeutic treatment that i've ever been in practicing life with mushrooms and that has drastically changed my entire well-being my entire being has drastically changed since i started regularly regularly using psilocybin mushrooms so with this um i have been taking it i take it i micro dose i don't trip i just micro dose i don't need any visuals i don't need to do all that i just need a more understanding of reality in the way that i live in my reality so with this being said i'm looking back on several months ago when quarantine first hit when my peoples and i were saying we're not getting the vaccine for several reasons we're not getting the vaccine we don't know this we don't know that and over this period of time there's been so much fear-mongering there's been fear monitoring on the news on social media uh etc etc and now that there is a vaccine and they've uh continued to propel the fact that there are several new strands of this corona and while i definitely i've seen the dangers of the corona virus in first person i've had family members that have gotten it thank the lord that nothing happened to them with this being said we all said we were not going to get this vaccine it was just it was not something that we saw as beneficials for our bloodline from our bloodline that's not something that we would want i say we as in i i from my past uh whether that was my grandmother my great grand great great that's i from the past um we wouldn't want this vaccine so how was it that i subconsciously i willingly went and got my vaccine i'm looking at myself in the mirror asking myself this what what how did they literally though like there's so many people that are just getting it whether that's health care workers people by will people going back to school it's like that whole rationale behind not getting the vaccine is being swept under the rug and i'm pretty sure that's exactly how they wanted it to play out these qr codes now uh you have to realize you have to realize it will be required to go into this store unless you have the vaccine i can understand going from country to country for sure if i plan on going to this country and they haven't had low cases or even because i don't look i can understand the rush that now behind okay at least if you're going to a different country but what if i literally don't have corona why do i need a vaccine what if what happened to not depending on the government to make sure that you don't get sick what happened to not depending on the government for x y z point blank period and they're just they're manipulating us into freely into doing stuff subconsciously but there's so many look we're gonna we're gonna dive deep into it i'm about to pull up a video of my friend brett and i just talking just chatting uh we did a little micro dose this uh day that i'm about to show you all it was a week ago a solid week ago uh we just parked out somewhere like we usually do um and we recorded our conversations i think it's very important for people to understand what we're talking about if you don't yet and more importantly spread these ideas these philosophies these these realities because there has to come a point where we don't keep allowing corporations and the leaders that we never see there has to come a point where we stick up for ourselves and our health and our being and it's not just over the vaccine it's not just over the vaccine and you'll see that in the video coming so i'll catch you all in a second no there's just we're at a point we are at a point where there's no return that's what the [ __ ] i'm trying to say we are at a point where there's no return where you're seeing things happening if you're aware of it or not there's things happening behind the scenes that we are at a point of no return it's going to happen and it's going to be normal they they do it they do it in a smoothest way where we all build hat build habits within us without knowing these types without without knowing it that's the thing and i'm so grateful for the ability to recognize it so most of the time that's the key because if you're not conscious of it if you're not aware of it you won't be able to change it and you're at a point of no return [Music] that is detrimental literally okay so the key is consciousness and awareness literally yes at that point you can make conscious decisions actually question yourself question everybody else that's what i'm trying to question everything question when i was a kid look when i was a kid i used to think everybody was a robot and and like it doesn't make sense today but it just makes sense of like i didn't understand what the [ __ ] all this was yeah at all i've always been like what the [ __ ] this don't this don't add up that's but that's a good thing because then you question because that's where the question came in that's when the question came in like hold on even if it wasn't normal why am i seeing this is there another part of this that we're not talking about or what and i there is another part of this that we're not talking about most of the mental illnesses that we label mental illnesses human conditions yeah you're a [ __ ] human a reaction to being oppressed yes in many different things yeah it's it's true that that makes no damn sense that every other human has this has this mental illness and maybe they're [ __ ] human type [ __ ] a difficult situation yes it's dealing with environment let's make things that are simple so not simple and it's psychological to get to us because then people label themselves oh i've got this oh i've got that and then they identify with it and then they start living as that and they don't change yes that's beautiful it's just so it becomes fulfilling prophecy using it as what you are yeah it's like oh well i've got this no i've got that they started living yeah i had to escape that i did because i i noticed it i noticed it man and it's hard not to notice it yeah really hard not to notice that [ __ ] i mean no it's easy not to notice that [ __ ] actually it was hard to notice it was hard to become aware that's really good yes hard to even want to take the pill and when you do there's no point i was resisting i was resisting it and when you resist it it's a hard [ __ ] time until you just be like okay you can't resist forever what the [ __ ] we all need to live differently for ourselves and for one another i'm breaking so many bad habits uh a lot of the bad habits i work i was not into like watching tv i don't do none of that um meaningless sex i feel like sex is a distraction a huge distraction i'm just going to bring that up i yeah that's something that's been implemented to us as well sex regular sex right regular ass sex i thought it was just to make a human being are you telling me that author talking about timothy leary in his books he always talks about like sexual imprints because that's what they are yeah like they hand printed sex into us in a type of way that is i don't i don't even know how to explain it yo i don't i think about it a lot though because just like in a brave new world that made me realize a lot of this [ __ ] is what we see today because remember when they talked about the kids playing with one another yeah and wasn't there a girl crying i mean like that's her standing out and being like why are all y'all doing this right yeah because from a young age i mean i've even noticed it from other people if there's two kids acting inappropriately even if they're the same age they're just like oh they're kids like isn't that part of the problem right exactly yeah i'll have to read that full book but most of the brave new world in 1984. it's going on and that's the thing like movies and books and all of this [ __ ] where do you think that came from the [ __ ] do you guys think it came from it's either gonna come true or been true or it's in somebody's mind and that that's probably going to be passed on like this is how energy [ __ ] works can we we're going deep down into this [ __ ] hold on because it always all can it always connects every single time we have a conversation it connects and it just gets to me because it's so simple yet not simple so let's just deep dive into this what we're experiencing today was in books written in the 1900s every single movie that we see it's either came true been true or it's in somebody's mind how thoughts are thoughts can be passed from one one person to another one thing from another energy we all know how energy works all the biology classes you done took what was energy diet yes information we are energy we are energy our thoughts are energy so it can surpass through things you know we're in a car my energy can go outside of this car it's everywhere energy is expected radiating low vibrations okay what are some of the [ __ ] science the science laws of energy um objects in motion stay in motion i'll check that rest stay at rest okay yes exactly so apply that yeah it's simple apply that to yourself next one we're literally doing science class it's so simple let me think uh physics physics energy chemistry okay yeah so these laws the physics laws or whatever the [ __ ] read them over again i'm gonna read them over again so i need to tell them to people and we just need to [ __ ] apply it to yourself because we are energy that's what i'm trying to say so if the movie if you read a movie if you read a book and it's fact or fiction even if it's fiction some of that [ __ ] science fiction can turn into science fact real quick ralph smart has said himself some of that [ __ ] that was science fiction back in the day is not a science fact right and i actually the lecture i was listening to this morning it was an hour lecture he was over here and this was in i would probably say the 60s 70s or 80s it was back in the late 1900s okay in this lecture he was like this mad mad house is a [ __ ] show and they were all laughing that was laughter to them if he said that [ __ ] now nobody would be laughing [ __ ] we in a [ __ ] show right now in fact it's the fat and he was in this lecture he was talking about stuff's going on he's talking about energy and consciousness so yeah whatever's in science class we need i need to bring up those laws yeah literally and it's whatever laws it is that was in science it's also the spiritual laws that's the yeah literally take the science class and then it's the spiritual class and then take it apply it to yourself give us a math class math class sacred gm people scared yeah people be scared of math but that's also implemented it's because school is indoctrination i literally have this they don't want people to be smart in america they want us to be consumers it says if we aren't being taught how to grow our own food how to take care of ourselves our families how to live without the need for huge governments banks corporations as our ancestors once did then we are being educated period we're being indoctrinated to be dependent and subservient to the system thank you for reading this can anybody debate that with me like am i wrong is this wrong and i didn't even say that this is somebody probably from the 1900s i said gavin the cemento i don't know so that's not even my thoughts and it's crazy being able to just see stuff from a simple but different perspective i don't know if that's the right way to say it but i always talk about the false currency the usd and nobody ever thinks about it but it's like they don't want you to think about it the true currency of the plan is not the us dollar the usr was made by a bunch of rich people that we never see they're behind the scenes and they can control you the true currency of the [ __ ] planet is gonna be the currency created by the [ __ ] people of the planet and not by five white dudes five six seven white dudes kidding me i always say the currency of the planet is made by the planet humans or minerals i say gold and silver but they have taken control of that in america and big governments but i keep my asset of gold and silver if we want to talk about cryptocurrencies the author i was and this all goes back to me reading books i know right reading books essential apply that please read books read your books because everything that we're talking about is from reading books from watching videos that we got from these books that we got from these articles that we got from questions use the 24 hours wisely they want you to just consume nonsense please don't what are you going to say so when it comes to cryptocurrencies it it just makes sense because and then i'm going to apply it to the future i see the future at this point i'm about to apply cryptocurrencies to the future so and these are in books i read and i believe it so i'm a talk as if i'm talking and that's my thoughts and i believe it because i do in the future we may be headed for space migration because you know civilizations end at some point we are going to end as a civilization and it ends in a harsh way at this point our civilization can end now but i don't want to be pessimistic but this is a a civilization-ending event happening right now i just want to point that out and we're finalization that's why we have to stay positive because people like you and i is what's keeping us afloat really if we if consciousness weren't a thing we're dead has gone it would have been gone as soon as this pandemic happened six months later we would have all been dead if people weren't conscious enough if they weren't fighting if they weren't aware enough to do whatever whatever am i talking about [ __ ] so with cryptocurrencies i'm going to apply it to the future whatever's happening with the future it's going to be technology included and i believe it's going to be space migration that's included because you want to know what's in space there's literally ever there's it's the universe it ain't just the earth there's going to be some type of [ __ ] happening going down the space we could talk about that no this another day but i feel like our first ancestors came from and they had to move yes and that happened that's what i'm trying to say that happened that's literally how civilization through time we lost it evolved and [ __ ] we came from another planet and every single time like when earth earth at this point how we're treating it like if we don't turn it around it's out of here and by the time it's out of here we may be out of here so i'm trying to be positive because we might have been migrated somewhere in space by the time birds so i'm going to get into a point type [ __ ] i see the future that's why i say a lot of these multi-millionaire or billionaire people they're silent because they're already working on it they have people working day in and day out you can like you can wait and they're sorry because they're [ __ ] greedy i'm still i want people to they're not allowed to wake people up especially some of them like at this point they could yeah they definitely could i just want people to know whatever is happening in the future cryptocurrencies are included it makes perfect sense it's on this thing called blockchains literally every single thing every single thought we can include blockchain in our body and every single thought every single limb is connected that's blockchain every single everything is connected and it's blockchain so that's technology and we implemented even if we go to space there's going to be cryptocurrencies that can survive yet yeah i'm pretty sure that people that invest in crypto are going to be the ones that are able to go off yes and they know this i think they know this so because this is books that i'm reading i've read books people know this [ __ ] this is [ __ ] going on behind the scenes and when it comes to public there are the other plans being made type shade so with cryptographics i got some cryptos that are busting right now and i'm just holding it and they're investing that's why you're telling me like yeah no just hold i've the most profitable people profitable is just holding yeah so we're just going to vibe here and i'll catch you all later this is brett by the way grateful all right bye so that is all for this video uh if you are wanting to get in tuned with the new wave uh like subscribe follow me on my social medias because this will be a forever journey for me i'm just going to keep speaking my truth the truth our species truth there's so much opportunity to do things today that our ancestors many of our ancestors were not able to do and now is the time for us to be true to ourselves and prosper with that truth okay you all stay elevated continue forth on your on your path be one with yourself love adore yourself spice is loving up on me all right i'ma head on out peace love well being adios you ,2
16,dCkuTnA8ua4,Jeffrey Epstein the sexual Jeffrey Dahmer was a notable financier with upwards or possibly exceeding a billion dollars over five luxury residents including a private island for private affairs and most notably Jeffrey Epstein is infamous for being a rapist and a pedophile there are two things here that I've noticed the news has been negligent to cover or largely misleading first of all what Jeffrey Epstein was charged with is in itself a crime he was charged for a second time with two counts of solicitation of prostitution first and foremost his victims that number in the scores possibly exceeding a hundred many underage are victims they are not prostitutes Jeffrey Epstein had a billion dollars when you have a billion dollars everybody in your sphere is paid by you that's what being rich is like if you don't believe me listen to Chris Rock talk about being rich I couldn't find a clip of it but this is an excerpt from Chris Rock's tambourine as most recent special on Netflix and the crazy thing is so after you get through the custody thing then you got to divide the money that's I'm talking scary [ __ ] man and whoever whoever makes the most money has to pay the legal fees for the other person so I did pay for a lawyer to divorce me that's like hiring a hitman to kill you it's like okay here's the picture of me I'm gonna be a Burger King at 10:38 okay shoot me in the head and give me a call so I'm in court yeah one day I'm in court and I'm just looking around and you know she got three lawyers I got three lawyers shit's expensive his [ __ ] she got three lawyers I got three lawyers the judge that they let this des nog refer and I'm looking at all these [ __ ] like I was like wow look at this whole town just here and I'm looking at all these people and I realize like everybody in this room is far more educated than me everybody I dropped out at Boys High okay got College [ __ ] coming to me right and I realize everyone in the room born to much better circumstances than me and everybody in there is there to take my money it's like everybody in here is gonna leave with more money except me and they got up that morning they brush their teeth they put on suits they fix their hair with the sole purpose of taking my [ __ ] and at that moment I realized something I made it I made it started from the bottom now I'm here I made it man it and after that I was like [ __ ] it take it whatever you need take it I'll be all right I'm gonna work gonna be good so it's key that we remember the victims for being victims and hold them to a higher esteem the other thing that is largely misleading is that New York City medical examiner Barbara Sampson declared Jeffrey Epstein's that to be a suicide well Jeffrey Epstein's lawyers say that his death was much more consistent with a murder than a suicide and that's putting it mildly the autopsy showed that Jeffrey Epstein had three fractures to his hyoid bone and his neck a study from 2010 to 2016 showed that in 264 hangings only 16 a mere 16 showed just damage in the hyoid bone for Jeffrey Epstein to a fractured his hyoid bone in three places alone by himself in a jail cell is statistically impossible it's an impossibility also the Wikipedia article on Jeffrey Epstein suggests that Jeffrey Epstein was not only harmed by his cellmate two weeks prior to his death on August 9th or 10th of 2019 he was paying other inmates to keep from being harmed so what do we have here we have a history of violence towards Jeffrey Epstein in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City there is a pattern of abuse and fear for his safety and the statistical impossibility of fracturing your own neck in three places and it so there is no way to do it it's impossible Jeffrey Epstein was murdered there's no ifs ands or buts about it [Music] ,3
17,z59UzF5J1Zc,well fred i want to talk about today the montauk project we've never talked about that before and what i've seen in a lot of these cases is they relate to other cases right you know and um i didn't really put the connection together that the montour project came off of the philadelphia experiment and there's even more that relates to the montauk project well quite a bit of stuff happened there yeah your mk ultra was going down there yeah um a water of your um weaponry um they say that uh um in alaska harp harp was actually thought of there they actually had a tulsa lab yeah but you know what i find interesting is that if you think of roswell you know like what else came off of roswell you know like we talked about the you know there was like uh different crashes that aztec i think crash and linda darnell and all that you know like you had all this stuff come off of these storylines you know this one actually there's like four or five different branches that come off of this so let's get into it talk about the montour project and the philadelphia experiment it's all based i don't give a soda's book fred the montauk project by preston nichols yeah you thumb through it i mean that i bought that book there was something on discovery channel talking about the montauk project and they were interviewing uh some of the people and you know it's like every channel now they have a ufo or paranormal show they do five six episodes and they never see them again they just get new people so it gave me the idea and i said well what's what's going on with this he he intertwines the uh the montauk story with nazism world war ii the only thing i don't like is that preston nichols he makes this statement in the beginning the book that says whether you view this as real or science fiction you know that makes me very leery if it's a true story why would you say that because you know when i write my books which are sci-fi i actually wanted to write one like that that was a diary that you found and say whether you believe this or not i see that's what you want to say because then they don't know what is real no apparently yeah you could be if you have something inside say for example ufo we say you can believe this is science fiction or that i mean yeah it's taken away from the ufo so you're not really believing it's a ufos you know well you know but so what happens is he writes and he says in the book that his verification is that uh he this is 1992 he wrote this he runs into this guy named duncan cameron and and that's after the thing ended in 83 but before his book that's the source of this information duncan cameron and his brother were on the philadelphia experiment right and they went back in time forward in time to 1983 you know and duncan jumped off the ship the brother stayed on the ship so when he came back there was only one brother they don't know what happened to duncan he was 40 years ahead in the future so when he makes his way out to montauk that's when he meets um preston nichols gives him this story and that's where the story comes from is now the verification for the story and he jumped off the eldridge was the show that was with the philadelphia experiment you know and he verifies a lot of the technology that you mentioned you know tesla technology all of that comes from this guy duncan cameron so this takes place on long island it's it's at the camp hero base which was an old world war ii air force base and they claimed that these experiments went on there from 1970 to 1983. okay so now i lived on long island i moved to long island in 1970 you know so that was interesting but this is was about 80 miles east of where i was living you know the guy that got uh is in jail out there where he lives did he live with somewhere uh four john ford yeah he live around that area you know he's not far actually he would be halfway between me and camp hero with john ford he was maybe 30 miles or 40 miles closer to this area than i have he's seen what he said he said well i think he definitely did see something and he got set up by the commissioners there because he was making waves you know so this is all consequence of the philadelphia experiment that went from philadelphia to norfolk virginia and came back in 1943 now what the philadelphia experiment was was a tesla cloaking device that we were trying to come up with a way to to our ships not be seen by the german ships and the german submarines so they were working on a way with tesla to cloak the ship tesla pulls out of this because he didn't really want anything to do with the military he just wanted to invent stuff you know so he pulls out so like i said the ship vanishes goes down to norfolk comes back to virginia a lot of the crew is missing that guy jumped others are actually fused into the hole some went insane because it really did something to their minds as they went through a dimension and the the technology that's linked to this the montoya project also has time travel right so it wasn't just cloaking and going to a different location it was time travel they went through like a portal or something right so uh now the information uh from uh about the philadelphia experiment obviously the military knew about it was their project and others but carlos allende contacts the navy and gives him this information which is this book here the case for the ufo now my book is case for the ufo his is the case for the ufo so i i obviously i definitely love the club and this is the viral edition which means it was printed by the viral company but it was the navy that printed the book so in this book it talks about extraterrestrials and all of that plus the philadelphia experiment so that's the book uh that you know it ends up getting written by uh morris jessup but the information comes from carlos allende right through the navy carlos isn't that the one that uh gorman talked to yeah i think so he was here in new kensington yeah he's from new kensington pennsylvania yeah so in that book there's all information about about uh aliens is is what it is so this guy boris jessup like a lot of these guys if you remember when we talked about uh frank scully and mr dr g you know dr g invented a way of tracking submarines well morris jessup is an astronomer he's the founder of the ymcas and uh he was an original ancient alien archaeologist he visited all of the ancient sites in the 40s and 50s and his books talked about that prior to eric von danigan he went to balbach cusco the pyramids he went to all of these places which is why the navy involved him and said look here are these letters we want you to figure this out is this real is it not real the stuff from allende right so so they get this guy a prominent person they give it to him the navy prints this stuff up uh from alende the philadelphia experiment is described in there too they give it to jessup to do the investigation in 1956. 1959 jessup commits suicide yeah and his notes well you know it's well that's yeah you know what his note said we are their cattle yeah we are their cattle so basically they can do anything they want to us but the funny thing is he commits suicide down in florida right and florida laura requires an autopsy no autopsies done and they said like what he did was he i think he plugged up the uh the exhaust with a wet rag and the tailpipe and stuff and they would they questioned people who looked at it said that wouldn't have worked and you know the way he did it he said that wouldn't have created enough to kill the guy and there was no autopsy ever done but in his mind with all he knew about the ancient alien stuff and sites this was enough for him to say that's it you know where their cattle we don't have free will they can do with us whatever they want and he kills himself now the guy with the pipe that's allende ten years later in 1969 allende who's from new kensington pa right here surprised how many of these people originated out of pennsylvania better believe it i'm stunned how many came out of pa you know even today linda moulton howe um lynn ketai there's a george knapp it's amazing how many of them came out of pennsylvania originally yeah well yeah so in 69 allende goes to apro which is a big group right our afros like nightcap and he gives them an affidavit notarized saying the philadelphia experiment was real okay now some of the notes out of the book say all science breaks down when confronted with the origin of man's intellectual development that's not evolution you know humans die due to gravity's wear and tear rocket propulsion will never solve space travel so i agree with that gravity ages us where if you were in space i don't think you'd age as quick and rocket technology is never going to get us where we want to go it's not going to get you out of the solar system with humans you know so that's not going to work you have to go faster than that they have and this is written now 50 years ago you know 60 years ago they have been here from the dawn of civilization man's ego is at stake i believe that you know because we wouldn't be the top predator then uh they will not allow humans humans to blow this planet up when it is the only one in a great distance which offers supplies and a haven for space travelers the moon is a recent acquisition of earth now people have said that if you look at the the milky way galaxy right that's my hand the earth is like right here on the outer edge from the center of it so if you needed to go from the middle from the middle to here you could refuel restock supplies and then leave the milky way galaxy because that's where we're located so there's a lot true about what this guy says you know and we know that the moon is nearly twice the age of the earth right so it came from somewhere else did it was it man-made or was it really who knows they got stationed there one way or another i find that whole story to be incredible also you know uh there are two distinct species that have come here and they live in the ocean and and in space they can go in space well think about if you can fly in space you can go underwater you know because of your airtight and you have some sort of technology that parts the electrons and parts the oceans and stuff you know or space and you don't get hit with debris out in space meteors right they're small in stature with four fingers there's good ones there are evil ones the open seas are a natural home for them and provide an easy catching place of men and fish okay so because because the men are out there on these on these boats right the deep space is not for every man sailors can make the long voyage so they are kidnapped think about that if you're on a ship for months back then you know you're used to this confinement and loneliness so their thinking is we're going to take sailors who are used to the confinement and the loneliness they're the ones we're going to kidnap for this long trip in space it's kind of interesting to think of that you know a diseased person once taken may not be desirable and is dropped off you know remember the species movie in 1995 with natasha henstridge species she was that alien and she goes and there's the guy and she goes back to his apartment but there's bottles of insulin and she she senses he's there's a disease she left because he he had an abnormality you know that that was cool and that's what he's talking about if you were a perfect genetic specimen they didn't want you and you know a lot of times like fish fall from the sky no i mean people have said they want to take shark so they catch other stuff in the net so in the ship they sort through they throw the rest out and boom that's what lands where how do these things just fall from the sky you know really it's not tornadoes you know that's what they say yeah but i don't believe that you know so uh humans love to impose their will and make war we learned not to war they went home after a war involving small asteroids as weapons and the remnants are under the sea so what they were doing and i think you see this in the mahabharata in indian india they talk about a war that took place in the sky so but what he's saying is they would take meteors and small rocks and asteroids and that's what they would redirect because you think about it if you are based on earth and they can shoot a half-mile asteroid you take out the size of texas yeah so there was some sort of a war that took place you know with either smaller meteors or or asteroids i mean the whole thing if nothing else is extremely creative and jessup it was too much for him to handle when he got this additional information from allende he committed suicide you know so so that's the philadelphia experiment right but what comes from it is the montauk project in 1970 you know 27 years later they were doing experiments they had this chair and they would put you in hook you up and everything it was called the montauk chair and from your thoughts you could create things if you certain people had the ability so you could sit and think and this bottle of alcohol if this is what you want to do or white label boom there it is with your drink but they had this chair they said you could create through the chair one of the things that comes out from this a beast from the unconsciousness of one of the people in the chair i guess if you're not a perfectly stable person this guy is thinking or he's got a real something wrong with him you know so this beast comes from his subconscious this is a real picture this is a picture of what they took there at montauk of this dark shadow thing it kind of looks a little bit like a bigfoot maybe you know it kind of does you know but it the only thing i don't like about this storyline is this is what happened in the movie forbidden planet remember from the conscious the thoughts they created this creature that came and killed everything and but so it's are they copying it or is it real you know i don't know but that was my first thought when they started talking about bringing something through your consciousness that they're talking that was the forbidden planet movie you know they also said that they were able to open up time portals they were able to control it they could go ahead in time they could go back in time they were creating time travel is what they were doing but i think if you went back in time our version now doesn't change i think it just splits into another version of us if you go back and change something i don't know i mean there is no way of knowing what happens you know but the whole concept of time travel really came from h.g wells in his 1894 book the time machine right which was one of the greatest movies you know this was a good movie from the 60s 1960s was the time machine rod taylor he passed away last year rod taylor was the actor but what they said took place from 1970 to 83 thousands of males between 10 and 16 were taken they were taken to the future as slaves or soldiers and he says in his book that it was very similar to the movie total recall so the schwarzenegger movie with mars and and the travel and the time travel was very similar to what they were doing there so you could see how this this philadelphia experiment montauk project you know it gives you all these branches come off of it like total recall now like i said when i moved to long island in 1970 i was 13. so 10 to 16 years old but i never had any of these type of experiments experiences or anything like that uh you know it's funny one time i had a paper route and i had paper out until 11th grade i would you know i loved doing my paper up and it was like 25 a week i'd make and it took me a half hour you know it was nothing uh one summer my two friends and i biked to montauk point you know we didn't know about camp here we got there we stayed one night we went back this was about an 80 mile trip each direction on bike about about two-thirds of the way back i look around did my friends are laying on the side of the road they couldn't make it i had a paper on it so i was able to do it you know the father came picked us all up took us back you know but i remember we were walking around our arms our legs was like so sore from doing it but we went out to montreal point by bike and i think that was 1973 i was 16. so what he talks about is the nature of time and what he says is that we're pawns cattle right like on a chess board the example he gives is that the greek like the greek greek and roman gods like with troy if you remember how the gods would say we're going to do this when they just move the chess piece and you know and then achilles is fighting hermes right you know right right i think that goes on yeah i mean it does seem like like the matrix like somebody puts a program in and things change you know or or my belief is we have free will these things are done to see what choice you make but some things are actually done and it changes you can't do anything about it that's going to happen you know but it's to teach you lessons you know i don't know but that's my view is that it's all about free will and lessons to be learned in this lifetime you know so that takes me to now this whole thing going on with tom belong right if you read what he says right and he he created that to the stars academy of arts and science right he does his broadcast he says that if you listen to it i watched it a couple of times he says they have advanced high-speed craft that can move through water like what they were talking about and through time that you could be holding this glass right with this device you see here they can take that glass from you and you would where did it go and here it is on a small level is what tom delong says they have some technology now that is high speed and moves through time again like the matrix like you know how he was able to move while everybody else was in slow motion that's what he's talking about that he has that they've acquired this technology he says he's he got it from the government from the department of defense is where he got it from because they released those videos to him so that's so so here you got this montauk philadelphia experiment montauk project time travel you know total recall tom delong's you know there are a lot of branches come off of this the the you know this guy committing suicide allende i mean there's this is this case i never realized i mean the philadelphia experiment i saw the movie i never paid a whole lot of attention to it tesla technology there was a ton and that's not it wait do you see this so i watch stranger things and i'm telling her when they said mk ultra in this i started telling the kids all about what i knew with mk ultra but then i'm thinking this is set in 1983. i watch season two and i'm saying to myself something here is clicking there's more to stranger things than than just what you're seeing i go online and i s and i'm looking up now the origin of stranger things is what i what i googled you know what was what was behind this show there it is stranger things was originally said to be filmed or based on montauk point long island it had to do with the mud talk experiment it was unbelievable because if you look at it right now what they do stranger things is set in indiana in 1983 and then i think of member erie indiana what the showdown was on so they did it in indiana originally was supposed to be on montauk long island if you look at what they do they got the base there i remember what i don't know what they call it base henry or something whatever there's a base but that is the montauk base mk ultra is involved just like the montauk project one of the there's a group of kids pre early teens one boy disappears a girl escapes from the base and she's got all these powers the mk ultra and stuff they were working on there were creatures like the creature that came from the the chair the mind you have that uh government facility that works on animals right by her too yeah you're right what was it called i can't remember what that is that's where they created lyme disease and it got out yeah brookhaven lamps i think it's brookhaven labs well we'll look it up we'll figure it out but you're right there's a facility very close to this who creates viruses and stuff with animals but lyme's disease escaped from that lab and that's how it's all over the northeast now came out of that lab near that it might even be the same one but you know they're talking about creatures into dementia travel this girl the kid this is everything from stranger things so stranger things came from the montoya project i knew there was something about this show that was just i said you know there's something here there's more to this show and you can actually go online and look this stuff up well people watching the show are seeing it from us but there there are some youtube videos out there talking about this now so uh you know that that's our show on on the montoya project philadelphia experiment anything else that it brings to mind with you fred i mean to me i guess i think i think the government has a facility like that still oh they do i mean you know like you're saying the mk alter that's still going on you know people don't believe it um the government can do things today that far beyond our comprehension because like i say i mean you'd be sitting in your house and they were there well you know one other thing you know you say about they're taking them to mars okay now again you look at pilates these young kids miss them and everybody's missing they're not old people they're very young yeah where are they going yeah well we'll get this two points before they go out of my head uh two points one bill clinton apologize for mk ultra there's video out there he got up there what's his name jumped out of the window yeah he says this took place and he that's out there bill clinton apologized so it didn't happen the other thing i'm watching a x-files the originals they're on tv now i'm sitting there watching it and i think the show was called unit 731 which is the japanese experiments on the chinese yeah in that episode scully is saying all these memories they were all being taken and they had these deformed people and it was that box car and they were all full there was a pit full of bodies they were taking the kids that's the montauk project that's where all the kids go are these government experiments or they take homeless people that are not going to be missed or i'm going to tell you another thing david say for example you have a kid and you they terminate your parental rights you're blank now you're nobody you're just a body there you have no name and no relative yeah they can do whatever they want to do well you know they said with project serpo that um like people you know would have had that exchange program with the with the ets from roswell we sent 12 of ours for only one of theirs which i find hard to believe 12 for one but what they said in that book project cervo was it's not that hard to find people in the military whose parents have passed away and they had no brothers or sisters think about it you're on your own at that point that's who they target not only that that's where you get your abductions why are they doing the abductions from the 40s okay is it really e.t doing abductions and taking us or is it our military yeah and we're pretending we're e2 you know you would be surprised when i watched like the x-files the old ones a lot of the things we talk about a lot of the theories now 20 years ago they were hitting on every one of those in that show very subtle they talked about it very subtle and but the new show that's out right now is very conspiracy based yeah you know and i think they're going to hit it real hard and they actually show aliens they showed the moon landing fake baby daddy is the uh yeah yeah yeah remember i put that on facebook you you replied to that yeah maybe that is the worst well it turns out the smoking man is now the kid's father no not mulder older father and yeah mold yeah the smoking man is oldest father and scully's the baby the baby's father and the one uh kershak or whatever yeah yeah yeah that's his dad too yeah they're all related to the smoking man so unbelievable but there was so much in though so you know in my mind a lot some cases are just a one thing i'll give you an example i was going to say ketchberg was a one-off right but do you know what uh my partner on that owen idler called me last week and he said i just discovered something i said what he goes remember 1968 night of the living dead pittsburgh he said what turned them into the zombies it was based on the kecksburg crash it was either the radiation or it was a virus brought in from space from kecksburg the crash created the zombie thing in pittsburgh i never knew that but but there you go no so so i don't know so uh i hear the cuckoo clock that's our show and we'll see you next time finish your drink fred we're done ,2
18,3OEBFYvDf5s,all right what's up y'all it's me it's kanye and it's michael um okay we're gonna go trim that all right y'all i'm back here with me it's me and michael we're gonna be doing what's easy and prevail here we're gonna be doing a podcast on we're gonna be doing some conspiracy theories all right first thing we're gonna start off with is i'm going straight to it fake movement okay so there's a theory that there's a fake moon and they never land on the moon they just did it in some type of studio or whatever like it wasn't real at all like let me show you let me show you that landing on the moon you see how this flag is waving yeah okay now if you're a space there ain't no air so how's the flag even waving in the first place you feel me see that was a red flag and there was a boot okay there's another boot mark and there's grass in the ground or whatever and it was a different footprint from the one that the suits they was wearing and just everything seemed very staged you feel me but how do you feel about that though oh she was [Laughter] i think it's fake because like if they're going into space and you go to space and you die how the hell do you know what to bring to space if the person that went to space didn't survive oh yeah okay there was another thing that i thought about too okay maybe because humans are so smart or whatever i mean you look like humans but um how if you have a whole jet or ship or whatever you going to a different moon or going to a different planet or whatever how the [ __ ] are you supposed to land like and everything in the pictures they showed us it's like i understand the planet was way smaller i mean yeah but it's like you could see all around it from just one picture of it it just doesn't seem right i don't know because they drop off half the damn they rock it anyways when they go up there yeah i don't know that's could be captain you feel me all right let's move on to the next like four times i'm saying and then it was like so many so many things that was wrong with in the first place didn't even make sense okay okay you know the ancient periods of whatever that we was taught about in school yeah i know what the tier means okay so those each one of those brick pyramids weighed 2.5 tons okay how the [ __ ] is humans picking up 2.5 hold on look at this there's two point three million stones on that pyramid there's no way no humans could have did that now what if some aliens from a different planet or whatever came down and built them pyramids all right it's that you know that bug no no no no no no think about it the universe is emptiness always expanding or whatever i want to say no aliens with no good technology just came to this [ __ ] and just made those nah i believe i believe that like when a person from like a phil or something or a god from back then that dutch the people were using slaves like no i think that people did make that like they were forced to though they didn't do it willingly oh yeah because remember okay i also remember we learned mr barcena class that they was doing it was like there was like slaves of benefits [Laughter] look look at teen titans go okay this is just something i randomly saw in teen titans you know how they be programming [ __ ] they just be mixing the trouble eyes so if teen titans they was talking about they had some like aliens and they showed the pyramids and all that they just be mixing the truth for lies that's why the simpsons they always be predictive programming and they put that [ __ ] in teen titans when they had the pyramids okay i'm gonna go to it three minutes shut up okay i don't try to fight this [ __ ] though [Music] okay it's not playing like oh play some now bro you see this right [Music] oh this [ __ ] is an alien you know star you watched teen titans before yeah i watched it before okay the sheer alien they just showed her as an alien they even gave her more characteristics they show her coming down [ __ ] putting pyramids on think herself because the humans couldn't do that imagine 10 people getting around a car trying to pick it up and moving it moving it you can't do that [ __ ] it's not humanly possible to pick up 2.5 tons but the go to a picture of the pyramid you're like a picture of it i can't spell it all i spent the right the first time god damn it bro look at how tall that [ __ ] is if it was even if that was okay what the hell they was even going up here imagine them trying to go up there and place pyramids up there yeah they had to be people following that from that [ __ ] i mean you could say and they just forced them to do it anyway but let me look at one brick off the pyramid that's what i was trying to see but it doesn't look like it breaks it looks like a whole bunch of those rocks put together yeah what a couple people definitely can definitely do that 2.5 them things look a little as hell too like if they tried to move that [ __ ] i don't know it looks like maybe five people if i okay maybe eight people can hurt her around that and then back then i'm pretty sure there was no strong ass [ __ ] like you know like me they could actually put in work like that so imagine eight people being hey now i'm that goat though you feel me but i can't imagine there being eight people being able to pick that up in that volume or whatever picking up 2.5 tons i can't even see nobody even i can i can't even see some of them people their ass used to be skinny as hell because their ass wasn't even eaten right i can't imagine that oh no i can't imagine i can't imagine some damn aliens coming down this whole look i can't imagine they asked damn lifted 200 pounds if they can't deal with 200 pounds separately i can't see how they lifted 2.5 tons together there's no way one way one brick wave two points yeah one brick didn't weigh that a brick probably weighed like maybe 200 maybe 500 something around there ain't no way but okay and it wasn't they didn't just have one people like look how many people look how many slaves they had during that time like not even slaves but like type [ __ ] you know what i mean all right okay two points okay there's they why would they be like okay we already know bro two point you can't see that playing 2.5 tons okay look limestone that oh what if they were just oh no bro i just i don't know i can't see i can't see someone like an alien [ __ ] coming down this damn why would they want to come here what the hell i don't know [Music] hey different different possibilities you never know i guess hey [ __ ] what i think what if they're here what if we air area 51. going to area 51 is actually you leaving this [ __ ] i'm gonna do a backflip into that oh me that's probably why they try to kill people that go next to that [ __ ] hey hey hold on in all seriousness how do you get a job working for area 51 probably got to be with the government yeah but this is like stem in the family like what if all they family just [ __ ] die now you probably have to be with the you probably got to be a signed contract or some type of dedication to the government so you got to do what they say you can do that just to see well you probably have to like swear on oath and type [ __ ] you know all types of security measures oh no i put that [ __ ] on put that [ __ ] on you now i'm joking [Music] if you wanna die bro but 2.3 billion bricks okay let's let's look how long it took them hold on what was that noise [Laughter] [Music] 20 years do you think they lift him look up how many people were used to build the pyramid i 20 to 30 000 people i okay hello 100k okay 100k workers by the monitoring you actually figured more than 20 30 000. okay let me go on my phone and do some math we gonna eyeball it for you okay let's do 100k plus 30k divided by two let's say there's 65 000 people working there people let's see how the ass looked no look don't mean nothing i know they don't mean nothing but that was not gonna be skinny as hell lifting though putting in your work but they worked like they did that for a living like they worked i'm not explaining but they wasn't weak like they they couldn't have been weak i'm not saying like they was totally weak but if y'all asked a slave or whatever yo ass not getting fed that much that ass probably ain't feeding you good yo ass got no breaks y'all got no time to recuperate only think they were slaves i forgot the word an indentured servant i'm pretty sure he doesn't remember that i just remember him saying they were slaves with benefits and that's yours like that 65 000 people okay let's say i'm trying to see one stone boom you see how big them stones is my [ __ ] them [ __ ] look fancy [ __ ] okay okay some of them some sources said when i looked there down they said 50 tons or whatever we just don't say they weighed two tons as much as a [ __ ] car if you have to place 2.3 million of those and you have to go up accelerate up like you walking up with them bricks stacking them down i mean you know what i think what's up i think that all right you know how it's sand around like it was in the desert see like in that picture down there oh this car i forgot it was touch street touch screen all right no it's sand all around right i don't feel like those bricks were or the whatever whatever those are that they i don't think that's how big they were i think they were smaller and then from the sand clustering on top of the pyramids that made it look and made it like it made it look yeah and it made it heavier so nowadays when we test and see how heavy they were it's like tons because the sand piled up onto the rocks and made the rocks bigger you get what i'm saying yeah i i get what you put down but i feel like they were smaller and they stacked them up in a pyramid shape and then the sand just kept on piling on top so the pyramid got bigger and then like you know yeah i know okay but it's like okay how much you want to say they weigh okay if they were two okay if they weighed 200 it wouldn't took 20 years let's keep it above but there's like four of them like four of them look look at the pyramid down there one two three four five six like six pyramids no below yeah right there oh yeah you know how hot it had to be out there but it has to be out there slaving after picking up the pyramid bro i don't know all i know is if if it was some humans that did that oh there's some goats jesus two points someone would say at 50 but i'm not even sure i didn't read that always so i'm gonna say it was 50 because i don't even feel like going back to read that [ __ ] 2.5 bro 2 million 300 like talk 2.3 million stones [ __ ] bricks [ __ ] that's light work with my pinkies i'm awesome i mean if your ass ain't doing that next another video probably like a couple seconds after this one but all right y'all it's been one drop of like follow me on ig klg underscore easy you feel me if you're [ __ ] with me ,2
19,WmCfdMkCO0o,[Music] folks who thinks the 2020 election was legit it's a good question who does think that the election was legit clearly most of you probably don't think the election was legit some would say well the democrats yeah the democrats think the 2020 election was legit no they don't so who does the answer is nobody nobody with a half of a brain or someone might say the election was legit but they know it wasn't they would just be lying because of whatever agenda they have everybody knows the election was stolen they saw it with their own eyes um hello five states were stopped five states stopped counting all five were key states all five were where donald trump was leading and he was actually leading in big margins and in the middle of the night ballots were stuffed let alone the discrepancy i won't even go into the voting machines and then we have on videotape republicans being kicked out and them pulling out suitcases full of ballots and running it through the machines in the middle of the night but but that's not evidence of course them being caught on videotape cheating and putting ballots over and over again into the election that's not cheating at all no oh no it was completely legitimate no democrats don't think the election was legitimate i've got the proof that democrats they all know they all know before i get to the proof think of it this way who thinks barack obama is this strong you know christian guy because remember when barack obama ran he said he was a devout christian now if democrats really believed that barack obama was this big strong christian would they have voted for him no they knew he was lying he was just saying it to get elected no one really believed he was just chris if he was a christian like i am a christian if he was like me as a christian a it wouldn't have been part of the democrat party b if he was part of the democrat party the democrats wouldn't have voted for him that's for sure so do democrats know when their own people lie and cheat it's so frustrating of course they know but we don't usually call them out democrats like to pretend to be dumb to get away with things like little children when you have a two-year-old it's in human nature um it's just it's almost like democrats don't grow up and they just use what they did when they were two years old and pretend they didn't know you know when a parent catches a two-year-old and says why did you do that and the two-year-old's like ah well i don't know it's not even two-year-olds you you could have an eight-year-old and they probably do that you know why as a parent you say why did you do that you knew that was wrong why'd you do it well i don't know i didn't even know that i did it i i don't know why they they pretend to be dumb the kid really knows that they were doing something wrong but they think that will help them if they if they act like they don't know they can get off democrats do that with everything uh the election was still oh i i don't know if the election was actually still i don't know yes you do of course you know it's stolen um abortion kills babies well i don't know if it's a baby i i don't know yeah right you don't know that when a woman's pregnant she's pregnant with a baby you don't know that give me a break okay now that we've established that democrats like to pretend to not know things in order to get away with the cheating that they do or evil sinful actions that they do they pretend like they don't know the difference between good and evil they know the difference here's the biggest proof of all though the biggest proof of all that the democrats and especially their leaders know that they stole the election from donald trump is the hr1 bill they are trying to permanently change our election system federalize it and make it so that they can forever steal elections forever more take a listen to sean hannity explain the hr one bill h.r one we've been warning you about it this bill don't listen to the media mob they're wrong as usual this would destroy all integrity in future elections it would eliminate all competence in future election results with one of the biggest most unconstitutional power grabs in modern history if passed the federal government would be able to assert the state's constitutional authority to conduct elections with a series of mandates that would include a mandate for same-day voter registration a mandate for weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks of never ending early voting a mandate for automatic automatic voter registration it would legalize voting for convicted felons even those convicted of election fraud it would give democrats the power to eliminate all voter id requirements none whatsoever in other words hr one makes election fraud uh that much easier it makes election fraud permanent why would you not want people to identify themselves to vote in america i mean why would anyone say yeah we need to get rid of people having to identify themselves in order to vote to prove they're an american citizen the only person that would ever want to not have identification used for people to vote are people who want to cheat and steal elections and the democrats are open about wanting that's why they they do these things they their bills show you yes we want to steal elections yes we want to cheat it's more than that yes we have been stealing elections this way we got away with it it finally worked on a massive scale it's worked before but it was a little bit harder in the past it's not like it's the first time they've stolen an election but not like this and the fact that they could shut down the election do it right in front of your face and then tell you it didn't happen and if you say it happen we're gonna accuse you of being a traitor to your country to intimidate you because they know how guilty they are do not let these punks intimidate you that's what they're trying to do when they do that they're trying to shut you up they don't want someone like me saying these things and encouraging you to say the truth because then they will be busted caught and not get away with their evil ways but as long as elected especially leadership in the republican party because there's some really good elected officials i know some really good elected officials that are elected but they're not in leadership the leadership is too wimpy to even stand up and say you guys stole this election right in front of our face they were supposed to do it before they put joe biden in and completed the task that's when you were supposed to stand up republican leadership that was your window and when you didn't do it and you and i know elected officials elected a republican well i tried but i couldn't i did what i could no you didn't and your leadership didn't and you should have been all over your leadership to say you we got to be in front of microphone saying this election was blatantly stolen they shut down the elections especially in the states that were stolen you should have stood in front of mike's every single day calling the election a stolen election and not being intimidated but you didn't and now you're gonna reap hr1 i know i know they'll have to do with the filibuster the 50 the 50 majority because right now it's not in the senate where they can pass this with just a 50-50 vote but they can use that nuclear option and i don't know why the democrats wouldn't do it they've been able to get away with everything else they've been able to frame donald trump as a russian agent lie about it for four years and all the people that committed a blatant political coup to try to overthrow a presidency got caught red-handed lied to fisa courts lied to congress tried to frame general flynn got caught doing that not one of those people actually paid any significant price at all no one went to jail nothing why wouldn't they think they're above the law there is a two-tier justice system in america it's clear why wouldn't they try to unconstitutionally federalize our elections it's against our own constitution for the federal government to take that power away from the states the constitution gives that power to the states but what do they care to them the constitution they don't like because it's all about what the government can't do to you that's why they hate it and they've realized hey we're above the law we're above the constitution if we ignore it we can violate people's constitutional rights why do they think that they can get away with blatantly violating the constitution they used to lie and act like things weren't unconstitutional when they were but now it's so blatant what they are doing why do they think they can get get away with it i've always gone back to the mask thing when they were able to force everyone to wear masks i kept telling everyone folks if you let tyrannical governors use power they don't have an authority they don't have they can't create law only their state legislature can create the law governor cannot just create law they cannot force you to wear masks if you obey you're not following the law you're not being a good citizen you're giving power to a tyrant and if you give that power to tyrants they will know we can do anything we want they'll just obey even though it's not against the law for them not to obey us it's actually the proper thing to do it's actually the constitutional thing to do is not obey a governor who's tyrannical who oversteps his bounds it's your duty as a citizen to say uh uh i am following that that's a violation of the constitution you're breaking the law governor not me me not wearing a mask is following the constitution because it's my right to choose my own medical decisions and you don't have that type of authority to make a law to mandate that i wear a mask but we didn't stand up as a whole of course some people did but as a whole we didn't and you're going to reap what you sowed you sowed that by obeying and that obedience i warn people on the radio show that i used to do locally i kept warning people and those who used to listen know that i did i said folks you this is not about masks it's so much more and people just get so mad at me it's not a political statement to wear a mask i said oh it is to the left they're watching it's a test they're watching this is why they're having such a hard time letting the mask thing go they're having an extremely hard time they want to keep it forever you know laura ingram was talking about that she was talking about dr fauci too because a year ago dr fauci told the truth about masks i'm going to let laura ingram set this up for you take a listen and just for old times sake let's remember the wise words of dr fauci one year ago today like there's no reason to be walking around with a mask when you're in the middle of an outbreak wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better and it might even block a droplet but it's not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is of course he later did a 180. it's all for noble reasons though right he went from no masks to you must wear a mask to you must wear two masks it's time for us to break free from the cycle of failed experts and frankly unconstitutional orders if you're trapped in a blue state that won't open up that denies the data and the science that bows to the teachers unions it's time to get get up and either leave altogether or get involved in politics on the local level on the state level in any way you can and even if you don't get involved in politics you need to do your job and not obey tyrants your founding fathers would never wanted you to do so i know why people obey the tyrants they think that they're being polite or they think it's a law and they're being a good christian and they're following the law even if it's not a good law i want to correct those christian christians that think that it is not law they are the ones violating the law you are not breaking a law you're not breaking a bible commandment you're not disobeying the government you are the government in america and you have constitutional rights you're the one who is allowing the law to be broken it's like when you listen to a governor who is overstepping his bounds destroying the state legislature creating his own law becoming a tyrant and being allowed to do whatever it it's like if you watched a bank robber commit a crime and then you defend the bank robber after they stole the bunny what are you doing why are you defending the criminal the criminals here or the people at least who are breaking laws are the governors who enforced infringements on our constitutional rights they stop people from going to church it's right in this constitution you cannot stop people from freely worshiping let alone you can't stop them from gathering and they did that too oh in the name of safety and health right look in a free society you get to decide your risks if someone wants to stay at home because they think you know it's too dangerous there's a pandemic out there stay home i have no problem with that if you want to wear a mask i don't care that doesn't mean you get to be a tyrant and tell me to wear a mask it doesn't mean you get to be a tyrant and tell me i can't go to church where do you get off thinking you have that ability where do you get off even trying to do something like that and where do the people get the courage to take a stand and say what i just said to the people doing that to them oh but they'll come after you the canceled culture will come trust me the cancer culture already came after me i already know and it hasn't stopped me it's only making me have a national voice they took me from a local voice tried to cancel me and now i'm a national voice because i stand strong and god will use me in whatever way he sees fit going forward and i hope that for you i don't want you guys intimidated i want to squeeze one last thing in just see if i can and get this in was tucker carlson and is talking about cuomo remember the media who lied to you about wearing masks has lied to you about everything they have lied to you about how awesome cuomo is tucker talks about that take a listen they spent all their energy slobbering over andrew cuomo been commended for your clear and your calm leadership people from all over the country in the world of tuned into your press conferences your statewide approval rating a career high 84 percent you came in second only to president obama as the most trusted democratic leader in america how'd that happen the media lied at that same time i was telling my audience about how cuomo put people into nursing homes on purpose and i said on purpose because it clearly was on purpose donald trump gave cuomo hospital beds for overflow he gave him a ship and converted it into a hospital and cuomo didn't use it instead said send the sick people into the nursing homes don't put them on the ship that donald trump provided or used the beds donald trump provided put him back in the nursing home now what kind of man does that you know you have these accusations these sex scandal accusations against cuomo i don't want people to get distracted by that i think the left is happier with cuomo having a sex scandal accusation than the truth about purposefully putting patients who are sick into nursing homes to drive up numbers for political reasons you know why because cuomo wasn't the only one who did it that's why there were other other governors who did it pennsylvania michigan we know those governors did it not just new york there's another state but i don't know for sure a hundred percent so i'll just instead of mentioning it i won't say anything but most of you know that these governors were doing it for political reasons and the democrat party would much rather have cuomo have the sex scandal take because remember the scandal about him putting patients in nursing home he was under investigation for that and that was getting in the news this takes that off it it's not that they want cuomo with the sex scandal but what i'm saying is is they might as well allow it because it's taking the real real big scandal off the front page that's kind of sad but cuomo acted like a tyrant cuomo used powers that he technically doesn't have because he can't make law and everyone in new york in new york obeyed and they're suffering the consequences actually of obeying cuomo folks if you want freedom you have to stand up for it do you know how many soldiers died for your freedom they fought foreign enemies and all those soldiers that died on a foreign territory so that people in america could live free imagine what those soldiers think about you not being able to stand up when it comes to wearing a mask you can't stand up for your rights you can't stand up for your constitutional rights how do you think that would make that soldier feel why don't you think about it from that perspective that might shake some people to the core because then that makes them think oh my goodness i might actually have to take a stand is it really that scary to take a stand for the country that you love that you live in why is that a scary thing if you have children shouldn't you want to for their sake folks if the left pounds through what they're trying to pound through it's going to be the end of america if they get away with it there is no sugar coating that what are you gonna do about it [Music] are you gonna be a freedom fighter are you gonna stand up to the bullies [Music] well even if everything goes against us i can give you the biggest hope of all are you ready for this whether you agree with me or disagree with me you better know this it's the most important thing you will hear all day and it's this jesus is the way the truth and the life no man comes to the father except through him do you know what that means do you understand that [Music] if you do and you accept it nothing can keep you down if you don't accept that oh well i'll just say i don't want to be you i love you guys that's why i told you that you ,3
20,mgZahMCulgA,all right welcome back to we the people reporting and I want to talk about today's news conference by Adam Schiff today's date is December 3rd 2019 he just left the news conference I'm reporting on the Trump impeachment investigation and there's a couple things I want to address here and I want to do this hopefully in less than five minutes because I don't think it's gonna take that long just to debunk and refute what he just stated how he just possibly lied to the American people now he stated on there that Ukraine interference in the u.s. election in 2016 it was a myth it's a theory it has no evidence no merit to it debunked all these things with Jill Biden but I want to discuss this because there's a couple pieces of evidence that's completely ignored by the Democrats and by shift and therefore pet rating a lie and a story that does not fit the facts you want the facts here the facts this is not opinion these are facts you can look up yourself online all available number one is political article in 2017 political entitled this Ukrainian efforts to sabotage the sabotage Trump backfired that is by political political is a left side leaning belief Trump hating a basically newspaper and they title this how it backfire that Ukraine's efforts backfired to sabotage Trump and they go on to list in here how Ukraine officials tried to help and work with Hillary's people to help get dirt on Clinton Trump himself here's what sticks he says Ukrainian government officials tried to help Hillary Clinton to undermine Trump by publicly questioning his fitness for office they also disseminated documents and implicating a top trump aide in corruption and suggests that they were investigating the matter only to back away after the election and they helped Hillary Clinton allies research damaging information on Trump and his advisors a political investigation found so here's the question political lying there they're not a trump supporter they do not support Trump at all are they lying dish the did shift look at what political found in the investigation are they lying that's number one so where's the where's there's evidence number one what do they find and in that article they list what they found here's another article from the Ukrainian government themselves the creating government prosecuted two men one of them was the director of the anti-corruption Bureau that was put together but under the Obama administration that corruption anti-corruption Bureau was established and formed under the Obama administration and by Joe Biden and sit Nick who was the director was Concordat privately in his home unknowingly admitting to helping Hillary Clinton and that's how the Ukrainian government convicted him by his own audio recording that was done in his home secretly here's the transcript here's what here's a transcript from the conversation that this the director did not know was being recorded about him but here's transcript it says Korea said today those Russians helped Trump your people sitting except I think they did yeah I helped to not him but Hillary I helped her and then Kolya says Yeah right then her position taught her right sit Nick said well this is how they write about it right so this recording that was done of the director of the anti-corruption Bureau set up by the Obama administration and under Joe Biden admitted secretly recorded and admitted and this is how the Ukrainian government convicted him and another gentleman for interfering in the 2016 US elections this is evidence and these are facts that shift stood up in the lied saying that it was a theory debunked and no evidence the Ukrainian government posted it was in a newspaper publishing about it said that the court also appeared to describe the two men's actions as constituting interference in the 2016 United States presidential election the Ukrainian government established this and convicted the director now that was overturned not because of the evidence but because of technicalities that the conviction was then overturned later by small technicalities but it was not overturned because of the evidence they had the recording they convicted him the first time and the crania government established that there was there was interference by these two men one of them being the director of the anti-corruption Bureau sent him again by the Obama administration cells and was supposed to overseeing corruption he himself who was supposed to be overseeing corruption was helping Hillary Clinton amazing how shift can stand up today and say that it's a lie debunked it's not true no evidence when the evidence is just in those two areas alone and there's a lot more people but this alone is enough so again I know in over five minutes it was easy this is easily debunked in less than six minutes that Adam Schiff stood up and lied to the American people so this whole thing is a sham it's a one-sided impeachment investigation it needs to stop we the American people we voted it will vote again and this is not gonna hold again the next election by the Democrats lying to get this man out of office which they've been trying to do since January 2017 when he walked in impeachment month after month has been going on since he stepped into office this is nonsense so again this is We the People reporting I want to thank you for listening please share like you're subscribing our YouTube channel in here on Facebook and again thank you for We the People reporting and god bless you ,3
21,eyY1h91OCxo,what's up you guys it's your boy troopy toad so i just want to have a brief conversation real quick and i want people who are listening to understand i'm not racist you know what i'm saying i'm just saying what i see and why everything lines up with dots and dots so i want you guys to really understand that tom brady is really a reptilian he's not a white person he's a reptilian and it makes sense now why they call this guy the goat why everybody in the nfl wants to play with him why everybody in the nfl talks good about him why when he gets mad on the sideline he never get called a diva why he gets everything and anything he wants when he says it is because in reality he's a demon in reality he's a reptilian that's just the truth when you just look at this picture y'all i don't know about y'all but i can see like two percent green when i look at his face especially when i look under his chin it looks like it's greenish you know what i'm saying and that's why it makes sense why they call this guy the goat and even when you look at his eyes look at under his eyes you guys see that extra bagginess over his eyes yeah that's somebody wearing a mask bro like in reality if this is not a reptilian it's still somebody else playing tom brady this is not the original tom brady and you can see like under the eyes that's not normal bro and i notice with everybody we claim that has been replaced and being played by somebody their eyes are always baggy like this bruh so that only confirms what everybody else is thinking we're right about and we need to stop second guessing it and another thing that what makes me think he's a reptilian is when you look at his [ __ ] neck his neck is so [ __ ] long bro and like i said his adam wrapper like i said i know i've seen that a couple times but bro it's just when it comes down to these celebrities and [ __ ] like that i put nothing past it bro i always stick to my gut feeling tom brady's a reptilian that's why he's called the goat just like right here again like i find it ironic like you know when he's not sweaty and on the field he doesn't look green you know but when he is on the field and he's sweating and [ __ ] he starts to look green that's because the makeup or whatever they're doing to this demonic reptilian is starting to come off because of the sweat and [ __ ] like that i know i sound crazy but in reality i believe it this is why they call this god the greatest of all time and they always make him seem like a goddess when they talk about him because in reality the devil is their god you know like look at his eyes bro like right here his eyes don't even look real i'm telling you bro tom brady's a reptilian just like when you look at this picture his neck is so [ __ ] long bro i'm gonna show you guys a picture real quick that's gonna put the cherry on top now we know the devil likes everything that god doesn't mean homosexuality sleeping with kids funnicating with kids funnicating with men doing all that type of things that the our god don't like that's how i know like i feel deep inside tom brady's a reptilian is because it's like the devil's doing everything that god doesn't like he's kissing his kids french kissing them and [ __ ] like that that's not cool bro i don't give a [ __ ] i understand you know those are your kids and [ __ ] like that but i don't think any man gonna kiss their kids at this age you know what i'm saying you know like bruh and what's gonna put the cherry on top look at his [ __ ] face right here do you guys see the side of his face it looks like it's shafting out from his face you guys see what i'm saying it's like his ears in this jawbone line that we're looking at is sticking almost out it's like it's coming out it looks like it's popping out this is definition of seeing a [ __ ] reptilian [ __ ] look at the neck you see his adam's apple like it don't look like an adam's apple it looks like a reptilian [ __ ] face you know how reptilians all have that [ __ ] under their chin yeah it looks no different than right here bro and just that side like when you really look at this side right here bro like that shit's over his neck you know what i'm saying like it's sticking so far out it's over almost his whole face you know what i'm saying and that's why i'm like bro tom brady's a reptilian and it all makes sense now why they glorify him why they do everything for him and it makes and i find it ironic how these elites they'll continue to use the racism to keep us people divided but in reality it's a reptilian playing him you know so instead of it being a reptilian playing a black guy and he being the greatest of all time it's a white guy so we look at it still as racism we still look at it as it's they're still trying to divide us that's how they mind manipulate us a lot of these high rank guys who are white and [ __ ] are really reptilians bro they're really demons bro they're not white they're demons but they like to play the right role to make that racism still be relevant you know what i'm saying this is how they mind manipulators well like i said when it comes to these elites and these demonic reptilians bro it's not about race they don't care what color you are they just know race is gonna stay and play a role until end of times with his people because we're so damn divided but just look at it right here y'all look at these pictures bro how many guys he's kissing this is what the devil likes bro he likes kissing guys he loves kissing little kids he loves torturing kids he loves eating kids he loves doing everything with kids men too this is why we have so many pictures of tom brady kissing somebody it's real bro he's demonic bro he's demonic and we look at real quick if we go look at the antichrist and we look at how they view the devil antichrist look for yourself you guys and i'm gonna just leave y'all on this now i want people to understand i'm gonna make another video soon about the jesus character because in reality the jesus character was all made up by the antichrist and i know that because they're the one who came up with this jesus character so if you came up with the jesus character why is it why is the devil holding the jesus isn't it supposed to be the opposite of way isn't jesus supposed to have the heart of forgiveness or god plus i have the heart forgiveness and the devil is supposed to be relu relentless and [ __ ] like that so why is the devil holding jesus when it comes down to the antichrist pictures it's because in reality this is what the antichrist go by in reality this is the demon their their god is the devil and why you think they call tom brady the goat because he's the demon with the horns he's been crowned i'm telling you guys man it's just real bro you guys gotta really start looking into this and if you guys don't believe me about this antichrist stuff why when it comes down to the cops and [ __ ] they have the same type of badge it's just a star tilted the other way but in reality it still symbolizes this because in reality the antichrist they run the cops they run ever that's what i'm trying to tell people man

24,yMvVbOQTo94,what's up my youtube family it's your boy roberto checking in with another video guys so this is the big one so you guys know they're forcing the vaccine on us well they're gonna try to trick us into taking the vaccine um so it just ended former president barack obama george bush and bill clinton all said they would take the vaccine on camera in front of everybody this is this is how they're going to manipulate us and and they're going to try to get us to think that the vaccine is okay and and that things will be all right when in reality they're not going to be taking the vaccine it's going to be something completely different that has nothing to do with the vaccine this is how they're going to persuade people into taking a vaccine nothing's going to persuade people more than a former president or even a president saying uh taking a vaccine on camera in front of everybody they are trying to do whatever they can to enforce this vaccine on us and to get us to take it it is not worth it it's not worth it now i told you guys in one of my older videos that they would try to find a way to persuade us into taking the vaccine excuse me they're going to use some of you some big-name celebrities presidents as you see they're going to do whatever to to to to get the public to think that the vaccine is okay they're doing so much to take get us to take this vaccine what does that tell you it's all part of a plan and this all ties in with joe biden uh becoming president um so with all these former presidents saying they'll take it by the time the vaccine is released and joe biden takes office millions of people are going to get the vaccine millions of people are going to get the vaccine and when they get this vaccine it's going to have the numbers of cobalt 19 drop and the economy is going to start booming so it's going to make your your body look like a hero a hero and it's going to make donald trump look even worse because i told you the elites are against donald trump so they're doing whatever to make him look bad uh so they're going to make him go down looking really terrible and they're gonna try to make joe biden look like this this save all hero when in reality this is all part of their plan they're gonna the vaccine is being forced on us in different ways than we can imagine would you take the vaccine if you seen a former president or a sitting president take it would you a lot of people would you may not but a lot of people would and that's how they're getting us that's how they're gonna they're gonna they're gonna persuade everybody to take it they're gonna use all these public figures to to manipulate us into thinking that you know it's okay to take this vaccine when in reality it's not okay to take this vaccine y'all have to wake up it's all part of a game i predicted this a long time ago i said that they're going to use they're going to use people to try to get us to take the vaccine there are some terrible side effects from this vaccine terrible side effects that they don't want us to know about this is the quickest vaccine in history quickest it's all part of the plan so wake up and pay attention but don't fall for this vaccine it's not worth it three presidents taking the vaccine on camera you're really gonna fall for that you're really gonna fall for that no we're not like i said this is all part of a scheme um those vaccines are going to have some terrible side effects in the future and this is how they're going to control the population this is what the elites are going to do these this vaccine may even brainwash people into becoming puppets that might be something to the vaccine it may not be the control it may not be to eliminate the population it may be to control the population and by doing so the vaccine will put in people's head that they have to follow the leader and they will have complete control over the public and this will make it easier for the elites to take over and pretty much put us in concentration counts and make us slaves and it's okay with us without us even having any care in the world something about this vaccine isn't right not right just wake up guys and and you're gonna see what's really going on in the world but that's it guys i just wanted to update you on that and uh i'll talk to you guys later be safe don't take that vaccine ,2
25,T3zh6erGy6E,what's up my youtube family it's your boy roberto checking in with another conspiracy video guys so stick tight watch this video because i am about to talk about the new world order and how the republicans the reptilians and the demon democrats are starting to work together and how this means this is terrible news for the rest of the world and the united states so stay tuned and watch the video so in case you guys don't know the demon democrats and the reptilian republicans have been somewhat getting along like getting along and starting to agree with each other on certain topics the republicans are starting to change their views on certain things and the democrats are starting to change their views on certain things and the reason this is very important is not because we already know they divide the country intentionally between parties they have one they have you have your republican people you have your democrat people and then you have the people that are just very few people there just in between so now what they are doing because this is all the scheme this is all part of the plan these politicians quite frankly don't care about us and they probably never will care about us but the whole goal is to deceive us and divide us by having two different parties and making people hate each other one party has these agreements one party has these agreements in the end they have a big disagreement and guess what we the people pick parties so when our party doesn't agree with the other party we attack one party and guess what we do to those people that support that party we attacked them too well now what you're seeing is the republican the dem the republicans and the democrats trying to get along and this is all planned by them because they're working towards a one world government and this is the bad part this is why i say it's not good for us yes it may stop division within the country if the parties do start getting along and starting agreeing with each other yes on paper it does not look like they're agreeing because anytime they vote on something it's still the same thing but the disputing and the arguments are starting to calm down and they're starting to agree on certain topics a lot of topics they're starting to agree on and that is the scary part because they're planning this correctly they're going to start agreeing more they're going to make the people in the country think that we're starting to unify as a as a country as a whole the parties are starting to work together which is what they should be doing without trying to manipulate us but the only reason they're doing so is because they are working towards a new world order a one world government and in order for the united states to get this one world government and to get this new world order in place they have to get along they have to work as one they have to work as one party they can't be divided these politicians cannot be def divided and there's not no problem for them but they're trying to find a way to slowly get the american people to work together and to not be divided anymore so that when we take let me not say we when the american government takes over the world as the new world order the new one world government it won't be any division within the country the the country will be a team together and the government of the united states which will nine times out of ten be the leader global leader of the world because we already are the global leader of the world but we will to be the ultimate government of the world the president of the united states will be the president of the world so what they have to do is get us together and they're gonna divide all the other countries they're gonna put they're gonna they're gonna put more division within the other countries and the countries that are unified they're gonna break that up they're gonna break it up and the reason you don't want a one world government because everybody follows the same set of rules everybody answers to the same person everybody abides by the same laws and the scary part is it's gonna start turning into a dictatorship we're going to start seeing the president the most powerful person in the world become a dictator because the power is going to get to their head their american government is going to enjoy this power having control over the rest of the world this is what it's always been about it's controlling the world the united states has always been a controlling country wanting to butt into everybody's business wanting to control everybody's country wanted to control everybody's resources [Music] and if you don't listen to the united states they go to war with you and they take over that way [Music] the united states is moving one step closer to the new world order the elites know this the elites are pushing for it and once the united states decides to band together as a government they're gonna they're gonna they're gonna take over all the other governments they're gonna kill off leaders like kim jong-un vladimir putin they're gonna they're gonna take they're gonna go out to china's president but i'm pretty sure he'll take a step to the side because of fear so not only will the united states run the most powerful country in the world then number two more than likely the vice president to the united states president or the country of the united states will be china's president and we all know how that's gonna go the united states is going to implement strict rules on other countries we may see us going in reverse back towards another time slavery with the united states bullying other countries and using the other countries people the workers for hard labor guys the new world order is among us martial law will come into effect the united states will start putting people in fema cap fema camps this is not what you guys want this is not what you want and not only that united states is already greedy so countries that are already poor is gonna get milked of all their resources and not only that the countries that are rich right now not going to say necessarily rich but very strong economies are going to get milked by the united states united states government will take over the rest of the world they will make every country poorer they will make every world leader bow down to them they will strip countries of they have kings and queens they will strip them of the crown all the resources will be coming back to the united states yes we may be living good here but think about the rest of the world guys if we're getting much closer to a new world order martial law will come into effect military united states military will be in some of the streets of some of these countries forcing their citizens to abide by the laws y'all stay woke and watch as the united states government starts to band together they have a plan and the plan may hurt the rest of the world big time and this may be when the aliens decide to step in stay woke guys have a good day ,2
26,uu6Mm2rluLc,welcome to truth or tube it's uh march 17 2021 this is mad a and mystic sky watcher all right guys it's uh valentine's i'm not valentine's saint patty's day i'm surely been sprayed with lots of chemtrails lately so i'm heavy on it trying to explain to you guys why i'm so foggy enjoying my irish cream liquor drink while i uh show you some interesting things that i found today so let's play this video by john boy what's happening folks what's going on here i know do you guys know do you want to spread the word i spread this video on my twitter feed this is by john boyce channel so i'll show you his channel john boy oh why am i not subscribed maybe i'm on a different account right now all right here we go what's happening folks let's put genocide [Music] [Music] ah [Music] very disturbing because i decided to go research [Music] on google and yahoo find out what was going in inside these nasty trails being laid on humanity that's why i wanted to come out here and show you guys what i found the scrub of truth versus telling people the facts now this has been happening in all our skies here in north america and the united kingdom and australia that i can tell you because i watch it all the time now this week has been like this year this is in tennessee this was on the 15th of march 2021 [Music] [Music] now there's a disinformation campaign pain going on on google because if you do a search for what's going on what they're spraying out onto us you will see when i show you in a minute that they're trying to cover up and make it look like we're conspiracy theorists talking about contrails when you go to yahoo search it'll tell you straight up the facts that's the difference and i want to show you because google has been scrubbing things for many years now including silver iodide that does and what they do with the cloud seating with that [Music] very disturbing very disturbing this is so disturbing to me [Music] man look at the spider web they're creating total spider web full of heavy metals strontium 90 aluminum and barium [Music] with polymers so you're breathing that in and it's creating all kinds of problems with our systems and all of nature look at those uh hawks flying in it all right one more thing it focuses on rebuilding the backbone of this country working families the middle class oh boy yeah the devil's in the details that's what he said on that one all right the devil's in the details because listen here this is the research i was looking at earlier let me show you so if you type in chemicals in chemtrails google search this is what comes up okay what are they made of and look at how they um how they play their little game here i gotta be careful because i got a medical misinformation strike on my other channel last night imagine that so apparently they didn't like one of the videos or something that i said i appealed it i doubt i'll win that appeal but i'm down for two weeks on my other channel from doing anything so i have to do a different antics and it's gonna be hard it's hard to speak truth it's hard to tell people the facts because of this crap they're trying to scrub things and rewrite what they want people to look into and they come over on this search engine they're going to get a bunch a load of [ __ ] because they're trying to put this as this labeling it as a blank theory right here okay yeah their disinformation campaign is on and yes it's it's the the cocktails that i'm showing you that are throwing these planes throwing x's up in the sky that stuff's full of aluminum and strontium and barium okay aluminum is why people are having dementia and there's polymers in there which is plastics so it binds together there's graphene in there and this stuff is used against us in multiple ways it's like a spiderweb grid system and it's really deep now you see how this is like what's coming up okay so as as you can see this is uh not good information to go to i mean i would not go on there for any trying truth on that search engine now if you come over to yahoo and type in chemtrails11 barium and strontium this is what you're going to get what are they made of nanobot polymers and ingested by human beings that's what they consist of okay polymers are microscopic and enters the host through air water and our food supplies chemtrail particulates are part of the weather pattern patterns and they're designed to infect the entire human species and there is nowhere a human being can hide now that was just like sums it up and we can go into depth which i have and i'm sure and i'm trying to show you scientifically a multiple videos in my own mad scientist research so yeah this is what you'll get over here if you're going on yahoo and looking into this endangering human health yep okay so i did want to show you guys the difference there of their campaign of disinformation and then if you come over here because this is a book that i have been uh reading for last couple years to learn about the old morgellons disease and what's going on in the skies above with the planes and their deadly death from above the deadly trails they leave and this book dangerous imagination silent and simulation by kara st louis that's the book i have now i typed in this dangerous imagination silent assimilation and i went to videos this is what came up and i would suggest anyone that doesn't believe in all this that i present in my channels all the time is going on in our skies or other people don't understand what's going on or you want to educate yourself into the deepness of how deep it goes this is where you want to come and watch these videos by harold cartsvilla there's one good one um and you can go down this page in the next page and like pick some videos and maybe uh understand the co the complexity of our matrix we live in which is a simulated reality that the puppet masters the elitist create for us in our own cage system so yeah so of course like my channel right now is getting shadow band i had nobody over here i had one person but i had a million trolls on my channel at last night and um the thing is is that it's not going to stop me but uh yeah it is frustrating to say the least yeah it's really frustrating because uh channels like mine are getting buried i don't even know how to find anybody like new going live anymore it's really hard uh youtube has done a good job bearing uh everything so nobody can find anybody in my opinion yeah that's where it's taking us so um here's one thing i wanted to share with everyone since my channel seemed to be getting attacked non-stop with copyright strikes or minimalistic medical misinformation strikes or uh i don't know scam practices blah blah blah whatever they want to take down the same video twice even though i appealed and they gave it back to me whatever their garbage is they don't want a lot of truthers truths getting out there my channel's been messed with both of them so i started another channel nothing on there yet let me take you to it so you i i don't know how to find it but here it is i'm gonna drop the the link in uh chat here in case you don't find me on this one or that one because they've uh gave me some strikes or some [ __ ] and this is my other channel i'll be over live streaming so there you go so on that note yeah let me close that out so i have to be careful what i i i didn't know i ticked off them so bad last night i don't know what i actually showed that uh there's medical misinformation against the who this complete [ __ ] is what it is so okay so i have to watch what i uh play because and what i say because anything to do with the old pandemic scandemic it's it's really touchy and some channels get away with quite a bit but obviously i can't so on that note it's hard to talk about a lot of stuff anymore because our our right for freedom of speech is being taken away and let me show you what i'm looking at this this is a channel and i haven't watched all of them i've i've watched some of them but on my watch list here if you go to this channel extreme reality check all all smashed together all one word this one right here let me make sure i'm showing you guys on lagoon faces in the clouds these words if i say them too many times algorithms will trip up and my video will start buffering and uh cern and you know saturn portal this is interesting uh video i haven't got through it all but good channel check it out might give you inside of the occult and more about their warfare against us and our reality so how's everybody's st patrick's day going here's my uh i mixed milk with irish cream alcohol makes me tired i'm already really tired as it is so i don't have too much and it doesn't make me sick and i hang over so i'm good with that warm fuzzy buzz all right so on that note let's see i'm afraid to show you guys a lot of videos because they are really on my ass and i still want to be able to be able to stream and bring you information so i've got to be careful about what i show let me see this video you get i don't know if many of you know this or probably have heard of it or they're not surprised those who sought all our presidents are linked to one bloodline of exemplifying exceptional character yeah see now i learned that you guys can't hear the video if i mute my microphone but they operated under what was known every time i tried to show videos it always lags so it's really interesting they're starting and they're starting on this channel now where are the assertions you start messing with he is a god the old trolls was not subject to the will of his people but only to be judged by god himself these mighty men of old were successful in convincing others that god's mandate flowed through their veins and that everyday people should spend the best years of their lives working to secure the social order of their realm and for a time this was how the world worked documented in history yeah that's how the world worked and look at where it's at now that's the video you should go watch i'm not going to play the rest of it uh yeah this everything's to one king and that's what our problem is uh i mean it is sad i watched uh press secretary doing her circle backs earlier and uh man if we are in so much danger guys it's just you would wonder where what's what is coming and they let look at this toxic baby food they've known it there's been aluminum in it mercury look at 95 of baby foods are toxic i mean come on why are we putting up with this how are we letting these companies get away with it because it's part they're all part of the problem they're all part of the problem here's another good one never lose truth to k-a-f-k-a if i say it maybe i will get in trouble by this platform so i'm just showing you right here this video good one excellent one right here i showed last night i don't know then i took it they'd say took down my stream so i'm not sure i did so many streams like yesterday that on my channels that i'm not sure if it was the one but this video right here is an excellent video by colt 45 children explaining geoengineering i mean i do you wonder what's going on what they're spraying up there because i have books on it there's been many researches getting scrubbed some websites went down some are still up it's it's crimes against humanity and we all of us sky watchers and many youtubers are posting what's going on in our skies on a consistent basis and let me tell you they've been heavy at it and wow no accountability whatsoever sickening man it's real sickening yeah and then we're going to be going to a casual society which is end of privacy right right now that's what we're giving up is our end of privacy that's what all this is shari law in essence we're giving up all our privacy putting our muzzles on having to dance around our words to be on any social media platform forms speaking any amount of truth or anything against the opposition the controllers it's it's really uh pathetic then i got my channel which has zero people on now supposedly watching me because i'm shadow banned and highly targeted in all kinds of ways and yeah very frustrating to say the least so on that note uh i guess i'm gonna end my stream for a minute and uh try to get some more uh information for another stream but here's uh my uh channel backup channel another channel in the chat log here and i'll start my stream and see if that helps guys because at this point something's going on with my stream that nobody's come in here and i've been on here for what 20 minutes all right much love and light take care ,2
27,1TBxwXYBSCQ,have you seen the moon landing video conspiracy the video yeah okay do you think there's no there's no stars do you think we act that we actually went to the moon when we say we did obviously i think we've been to the moon but when we first said we did do you think that we went no i think that the what 1960 [Music] 2000 it could have been 1904 i don't know now whenever the the video was uh being live streamed because i'm sitting there like all right so you're telling me that back then their computers that they sent you know a a ship sent people to the moon with were equivalent to a modern day calculator that so so you're if you're telling me that how the [ __ ] did they live stream them stepping on the [ __ ] moon is that is all right how the how would they even do that i agree with your point i don't agree with your argument because the computers that like universities may have had were equivalent to a modern day calculator but nasa had the best computers of 1960. of not well you know look at look up what it was because i'm almost positive i'm pretty sure it was like 68. when was the movie shaking the table brian shut up [ __ ] yeah you saw him stop 1969 1960 so it's almost 1970. so i think by that point it's not too far-fetched so that we could live stream but i have enough trouble live streaming to twitch from my house let alone from the moon so you know maybe you're onto something well i know that some channels were uh i don't know if all of them were because obviously i wasn't alive in 1969 but i know that um at some point they were uh what they were showing on the the cable networks were vhs tapes that were already recorded they would take them put them in the machine and then they'd be streamed to the to the tv so what was i'm almost positive that uh we gotta look up one more thing was the moon landing live streamed yeah because i'm pretty sure that it was because i remember hearing a story about um uh yeah okay so it was broadcast live around the world on july 21st 1969. however um dude that doesn't make sense because they i just looked it up and it said july 16 1969 was the moon landing and they said it was live stream on the 21st so were they already there for a couple days and then they did it i don't think so like you go to the moon you're like hey yeah i want to go outside now not almost a week from now i mean they brought back a bunch of moon rocks one other thing like tons and tons of moon rocks well my thing is all right so have you heard haven't heard first have you heard the video of uh or the the audio of what was it uh new armstrong paris was it neil degrasse tyson yeah did you hear the la the audio of the guilt yeah yeah whatever okay mike tyson talking on but uh he was like i i don't know what this is there it's in the background there is lights floating around us right now have you heard that i don't know if i watched that part of it it's kind of creepy [ __ ] creepy and there was video too because uh it was like playing in the background of him like out the little porthole of the yeah the craft and and it was showing like these lights flying around now a lot of it can be staged now my question is before we move further into this i want you did russia ever go to the moon do you know the answer to that question i do not know the answer to that question i don't either did any has anybody else went to the moon are they allowed to go to the moon since we put a flag there is that kind of no we we own it it's sort of like alaska but it's practically puerto rico um it says soviet union united states japan the european space agency china india luxembourg and israel have went to the moon have stepped foot on the moon or have sent like satellites well no actually it doesn't even say that they've been to the moon it just says missions to the moon have been conducted by the following nations and okay because here's my point here's where i was going because we were neck and neck with the soviet union right like they they have they said that they were close to going to the moon and then we we hadn't publicly declared that we were close yet right and then all of a sudden here's footage of us up on the moon like does that not seem a little fishy like you know we're america we boast about what we do and then all of a sudden bam we're on the moon there's no point to come here ain't nothing here you do have a point there however um we don't know whether or not we've actually been to the moon well no i feel like for sure we have been to the moon but but now i guess i have the first time yeah the first time is what i'm talking about but because we 100 have been to the moon we have um a laboratory completely focused on studying the moon rocks that we got back and it's like the the place that they're kept during these little mobile carts that have uh like uh the atmosphere like atmospheric pressure that yeah like atmosphere from the uh the moon yeah so that none of the bacteria none of that stuff um dies or you know rock implodes from not having the right pressure or anything but here's my thing all right why won't we go back to the moon what's the point because time has passed that we don't know if it has changed rocks that we got from there 30 years ago may not be the same as the rocks that are there now we're more focused on going to mars right now i thought nasa wasn't uh working on shooting any more rockets up well i think they're because spacex trump assembled this the space team right what is it it's called the space team what does it what did he call it space force space force yes space force and that's within nasa right but then isn't elon musk doing the same thing with spacex well i know that spacex has i remember reading an article that said that they have successfully docked with the international space station so for like a uh not it's not called i guess you'd just say refueling mission um just like to see if they could do it pretty much right yeah they just brought i guess rations to them or whatever but uh why why do we even have people up there like what the [ __ ] are they doing do we i don't know have they really said um there's a movie i don't remember what it was called but basically they went to the moon first first uh apollo 13. i think that's what it was there's a series called like the first or something on netflix no that it was a movie and it's called like apollo 13 and it's like an imagining of why won't why we won't go back to the moon and the thing is there's like creatures or creatures or something on the moon that like takes out this whole crew or whatever and it basically explains why we're not going back to the moon was the earth actually round yeah do you not think the earth is round it's not a perfect spear but it's round jeweler well in the bible um i know you're a bible thumper so you're probably getting a little thumper um in the bible it says that the earth has been put on a pedestal or uh raised on a pedestal or something like that so that would protect that would technically mean like you think you can't it's on a pedestal do you no it's figurative speech brian you're the bible thumper here i'm just repeating what i heard i don't think they literally mean that the earth is sitting on on a big marble pedestal floating in the earth floating underneath the earth because that were true literally wouldn't we uh see the pedestal well that that would mean that the earth is round uh yeah i'm saying that do you think the earth was flat i'm just i'm just repeating what i've heard theirs is not flat i mean that's just stupid obviously the earth is round why is the earth round why do you say the earth is round so if there if there's an argument that if people argue the earth is flat right why don't they argue that the moon is flat or that mars is flat because they're even real i thought they were just holograms well you can see all right now you're just now you're just trying to piss me off is that what you're doing i'm just trying i'm just making the argument man why you're not why do you think why do you think the earth is round because you were told that the earth is round has anybody told you that the bible's real or did you come to that well you let me talk if you look up in the sky and you see the moon is the moon round yeah it's round right you can see the moon okay so when we send a dude up there into the space where they can see the earth and it's round how do you think it's flat did we go to the moon because how are you supposed to land on a hologram i still don't i i don't understand your point i'm not laughing here dude i'm being serious all right let's just let's let's move on to another topic i know you can't you can't tell me why you think the earth is round i mean like did somebody tell you that well considering i'm not a scientist we're not scientists who've done the research we kind of have to believe other research right um well scientists go out to to prove other people wrong you're right that's that's the whole point of research or to prove something right either to prove somebody wrong or to prove somebody right so why do you think the earth is around because you were told why do you believe this as you were told because common sense says that earth is round why do you think there's riots going on right now please stop i i have another conspiracy theory to ask you about okay yeah i mean i think we kind of took them like all right first of all let's just run through the a couple questions to finish off the moon theory then i have another one all right all right do you think that we went to the moon the first time um there was no stars just answer me yeah yeah right so now do you think i don't think that it could be live streamed and i don't think that there i i didn't see any stars but you would 100 be able to see both stars the flag was waving but there is no wind on the moon there that was one of the things i'm not going to argue that just because i mean i don't know moon rocks are really gritty right and they were talking about them always blowing around on the moon and you have to watch getting them in like little creases in your in your space suit because they grind together and they're they're really porous so but but we agree on the big point of this which is that we probably didn't go to the moon the first time we definitely have been to the moon at some point and i think we deserve to know why we won't go back is that fair to say well it was a lot of money to get there to begin with and it it so if you were wondering why we're not going back it was a lot of money to get there and we spent that money to begin with just because we wanted to wave our hog around because we wanted to beat the russians yeah we we're like you drunk [ __ ] can't do this and then we're like all right [Music] you ,2
28,_GHGFgUB-Ew,[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you take the red pill and i show you how deep the rabbit hole goes crow man but when the hitting hit i might milly rock to get up off it in the new days with my always that there's something wrong with the world you don't know what it is but it's there according to entertainment television in response to little nasdaq's latest video you see this is very scary for me people will be angry they will say i'm pushing an agenda but the truth is i am he is admitting he is pushing an agenda he is an influencer of the youth this agenda is targeting our children his presence and actions are a pre-planned movement his initial release of all town road soared to number one on the billboard 100 for 19 weeks becoming the first song in history to remain that long at the top mainstream entertainment heavily promoted his song as suitable for children old town road has become very familiar with the youth i saw you first does your mom tell you after mentioning boobies in all time i'm here to promote my little book c is for country i'm just out here you know my kids now have grown very attached to your book you know majority of that success i would like a tribute to kids his song was even used as lullabies for children and i actually sing a version of the lullaby song to my daughter she loves it she just goes ape crazy every time i play it this boy having a tool to old town row she was shocked because daniel has autism and is mostly non-verbal i mean it took us six months to teach him the letter a and without being taught are you telling me he's humming this song it's music that's how we reach him that's how we teach him the power of music isn't that something yeah and three of chalet's poor children have autism but daniel has not progressed like the other kids with therapy so this music and what is happening with him and repeating those lyrics is a really big deal repeating those lyrics is a really big deal what kind of message are the lyrics truly promoting it's a message of break the rules and do what is pleasing to you it is the same deeply satanic philosophy held by countless other prominent performers the do what you wilt philosophy by aleister crowley this meeting just begun i'm satan's son this satanic philosophy heavily impacts children don't even flip me off finger back where it belongs the power of music it's not just about breaking the rules but little naz's videos progressively condition his viewers which many are children into the occult his latest video perverts many biblical references it pushes agendas [Music] what has this world come to it's come to a world where drag kids actually exist and people do ketamine on a couch [Music] and one of which is pure satanism where little naz proceeds to give satan a highly graphic lap dance that none of us need to see and it wraps up with him taking over satan's dominion to top it all off he releases satan's shoes complete with satanic pentagrams and a drop of human blood mixed with dye with only 666 available they all sold out in under a minute the boxart contains an incredible level of satanic detail and of course luke 10 18 i saw satan fall like lightning from heaven luke 10 18 has been touched upon previously in my videos with countless artists obsession with lightning symbolism he's flashing all the same symbolism previously covered including wearing a black and white tile masonic jacket and all seeing eye jackets [Music] and one of their favorites covering the right eye and in my opinion it really is just an artist's way of expressing himself is this really all just art when he explicitly stated that he has an agenda is this really just soul art when they are using all the same symbolism and it just happens to be satanic symbolism watch my video innocent arts or packed with satan that thoroughly breaks down whether the quote-unquote art we are continually exposed to is innocent or is there something more sinister behind it not only that this video and my latest video sports contract with satan discloses what all this symbolism means check them out soon before more of my videos are taken down by youtube what were you doing last year last year i was i was on my i was at my sister's house i was sleeping on my sister's floor so how did a little nas really get to the status he is now a year later from sleeping on your sister's floor you had the number one first history making number one song for 16 weeks in a row 19 weeks in a row he came into the position he is now the same way countless other artists have i sold my soul to the i can't devil it no no i can't say no i made a bargain with it you know long time ago and i'm holding up my hand what was your bargain to get where uh i am now should i ask who you made the bargain with [Music] with with you know with the chief uh commander on this earth and this earth and then in the world we can't see i wanted to be like the amy grant of music yeah but it didn't work out and so i sold myself to the dev katy perry was originally a gospel singer but she was going nowhere with her career as she admits she sold her soul and started producing secular music with occultic symbolism and occultic messages with even her in hell with satanic themes and now she is highly successful it's the same story repeated over and over again in the music video can't feel my face by the weekend he is going nowhere with his music career until the devil literally lights him on fire this makes the crowds ready for him and his music satan is not a fairy tale he is very real satan the father of lies is running this world until judgment day he is going to bring as many people as possible to where he's going and he's targeting our children satan uses music artists actors actresses to initially appear innocent for the children to follow so what did you feel and what inspired you to come out at that time how it would be good for the youngins who listening to me right now and then those performers fall way off the beaten path into the occult in satanism taking the children down with them this has happened over and over again [Music] miley received her own pair of little naz's satan's shoes [Music] and disney is infamous for releasing films that appear innocent and are not and for releasing pure occultic films for your children to watch how it would be good for the youngins who listening to me right now little nastax is a pawn used by the true controlling entities of this world to test the waters to see a society is willing to accept blatant satanism and to see how close we are to accepting the coming antichrist they think you're some kind of god the man who returned from the dead [Music] the last days are indeed upon us this world isn't just moving in some haphazard and random direction it's running full steam ahead fulfilling saiyan's hands in the world in biblical prophecy saying is not a myth spiritual warfare is amping up your souls and your children's souls are at sake do you see the direction the world is heading and want answers to this the solution lies in the way the truth the life yeshua jesus our hope is in what lies ahead beyond this life for what is your life it is a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanishes away however for all that repent which is whatever is hindering you from god whether it be sin or whatever you turn from that and you turn to him and believe on the lord jesus christ true belief is lived out in our daily lives yet the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not bless the light of the glorious gospel christ who is the image of god should shine onto them so do as christ has commanded go therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit teaching them to observe all the things whatsoever i have commanded you jesus asserts and why do you call me lord lord and do not do the things that i say if you love me you keep my commandments because eyes have not seen nor ears have heard nor has it come into the heart of man what god has prepared for those that love him the time is fulfilled the kingdom of god is at hands repent and believe the gospel second corinthians 2 11 declares for us not to be ignorant of satan's devices ephesians 5 11 asserts for us to expose evil so please share this documentary and the videos to come we must wake up people to the deception of this world before it is too late let's work together to overcome may the peace of god be with you and your family [Music] you ,2
29,te8yLsnLkQo,in mid-october of 1964 kissing cousins Elizabeth and Philip paid a royal visit to a Catholic residential school for Aboriginal children in Kamloops British Columbia Canada William Koons was 12 years old at the time of the royal visit I was an inmate at the Kamloops school when we were visited said Coombs I remember it was strange because they came by themselves no big fanfare or nothing but I recognized them and the school principal told us it was the Queen and we all got given new clothes and good food for the first time in months the day before she arrived the day the Queen got to the school I was part of a group of kids that went on a picnic with her and her husband and some of the priests we went down to a meadow near Deadman's Creek I remember it was weird because we all had to bend down and kiss her foot and she was wearing a white lace boot after a while I saw the Queen and her husband lead the picnic with 10 children from the school and those kids never returned they took away those 10 kids and nobody ever saw them again we never heard anything more about them and we never met them again even when we were older they were all from around there but they all vanished the group that disappeared was seven boys and three girls in age from 6 to 14 years old they were all from the smart group in the class two of the boys were brothers and they were maybe from quenelle their last name was our news or Arnold I don't remember the others just an occasional first name like Cecilia and there was an Edward what happened was also witnessed by my friend George Adolphe who was 11 years old at the time and a student there too but he's dead now William combs the sole survivor was scheduled to appear as the star witness at the International Tribunal in two crimes of church and state in London England but William Coombs never made it to the tribunal he died of unknown causes shortly before he was scheduled to testify Reverend Kevin Annette a former minister of the United Church of Canada believes that William Coombs was murdered to stop him from speaking out about the Royal abductions and other crimes of murder and torture that he had witnessed at the school in a nutshell what happened was I was letting people speak from the pulpit about the crimes had seen in the residential school the murders in that I also found out about the land deals that were happening where the church was selling off native land of big logging companies for kickbacks and I wrote a letter about that to the church I was fired without cause and eventually thrown out of the church without any due process at all you know but that one thing led to another and I began to work about a lot more with the survivors after that the eyewitness ,2
30,p3Y19DTcts4,[Music] on the morning of september 11 2001 19 men armed with box cutters directed by a man on dialysis in a cave fortress halfway around the world using a satellite phone and a laptop directed the most sophisticated penetration of the most heavily defended airspace in the world overpowering the passengers and the military combat trained pilots on four commercial aircraft before flying those planes wildly off course for over an hour without being molested by a single fighter interceptor these 19 hijackers devout religious fundamentalists who like to drink alcohol snort cocaine and live with pink haired strippers managed to knock down three buildings with two planes in new york while in washington a pilot who couldn't handle a single engine cessna was able to fly a 757 and an 8 000 foot descending 270 degree corkscrew turn to come exactly level with the ground hitting the pentagon in the budget analyst office where dod staffers were working on the mystery of the 2.3 trillion dollars that defense secretary donald rumsfeld had announced missing from the pentagon's coffers in a press conference the day before on september 10th 2001. luckily the news anchors knew who did it within minutes osama bin laden the pundits knew within hours of osama bin laden the administration knew within the day terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them and the evidence literally fell into the fbi's lap the hijackers passport was found blocks from the world trade center crash site if you can believe that but for some reason a bunch of crazy conspiracy theorists demanded an investigation into the greatest attack on american soil in history that investigation was delayed underfunded set up to fail a conflict of interest and a cover-up from start to finish it was based on testimony extracted through torture the records of which were destroyed it failed to mention the existence of wtc7 able danger p-tech cybele edmunds obl and the cia and the drills of hijacked aircraft being flown into buildings that were being simulated at the precise same time that those events were actually happening it was lied to by the pentagon the cia the bush administration and as for bush and cheney well no one knows what they told it because they testified in secret off the record not under oath and behind closed doors it didn't bother to look at who funded the attacks because that question is ultimately of little practical significance still the 911 commission did brilliantly answering all of the questions the public had except most of the victims family members questions and pinned blame on all the people responsible although no one so much just lost their job determining the attacks were failure of imagination because opening our government at least and i don't think the prior government could envision flying airplanes in the buildings except the pentagon fema norad and the nro the dia destroyed 2.5 terabytes of data on able danger but that's okay because it probably wasn't important the sec destroyed their records on the investigation into the insider trading before the attacks but that's okay because destroying the records of the largest investigation in sec history is just part of routine record keeping nist has classified the data that they used for their model of wtc7's collapse but that's okay because knowing how they made their model of the collapse would jeopardize public safety the fbi has argued that all material related to their investigation of 9 11 should be kept secret from the public but that's okay because the fbi probably has nothing to hide this man never existed nor has anything he had to say worthy of your attention and if you say otherwise you are a paranoid conspiracy theorist and deserve to be shunned by all of humanity likewise him him him and her and her and her and him osama bin laden lived in a cave fortress in the hills of afghanistan but somehow got away then he was hiding out in tora bora but somehow got away then he lived in abadabad for years taunting the most comprehensive intelligence dragnet employing the most sophisticated technology in the history of the world for a decade releasing video after video with complete impunity and getting younger and younger as he did so before finally being found in a daring seal team raid which wasn't recorded on video in which he didn't resist or use his wife as a human shield and in which these crack special forces operatives panicked and killed this unarmed man supposedly the best source of intelligence about those dastardly terrorists on the entire planet then they dumped his body in the ocean before telling anyone about it then a couple dozen of that team's members died in a helicopter crash in afghanistan this is the story of 911 brought to you by the media which told you the hard truths about his head could be seen to move violently forward and they took the babies out of incubators and mobile production facilities and the rescue of jessica lynch if you have any questions about this story you are a batshit paranoid tin foil dog abusing baby hater and will be reviled by everyone if you love your country and or freedom happiness rainbows rock and roll puppy dogs apple pie and your grandma you will never ever express doubts about any part of this story to anyone ever this has been a public service announcement by the friends of the fbi cia nsa dia scc msm white house nist in the 911 commission because ignorance is strength ,3
31,F0g6tg-tPms,so i asked them about their plans to kill people and they said yes there are too many people on the planet we need to get rid of of several billion and war doesn't seem to work so we're going to use disease and starvation he knew what was happening and he attempted to warn us when he left office he told us quite bluntly in no uncertain terms to be aware of the military-industrial complex and who is the military-industrial complex it is the members of the council on foreign relations and since the inception of the trilateral commission the trilateral commission as well i don't know if i'm a official member i've i've spoken there uh it basically is just a forum where much people talk about foreign policy was made up of the executive committee of the council on foreign relations now it is extremely significant that you understand that the first six members from the government along with president eisenhower were also members and long time members of the council on foreign relations they believed in that organization they believed in its goals which was one world government number 15 great industrial depression and financial panic unemployment hunger shortage of food use this to control the masses or the mobs and use them up to wipe out all those who dare to stand in the way well i'll tell you right now every expert i've talked to is talking about food shortage and it's coming i'm convinced what were they because they uh i'd never seen anything like that and uh and his statement was that if he told me i would be one of few people we are now recording again now if you think this is crazy and if you think there's no way that they could imprison you because you know what it says here we've got to be uh we got to be uh invaded an invasion of the territory of the united states earth's possessions declaration war by congress or insurrection within the united states and aid of a foreign enemy how many of you sheeple have ever read the omnibus counter-terrorism bill submitted to congress by william jefferson clinton and eventually passed and enacted into law by the congress of the united states of america which gives the president the president the sole means of determining who is and is not an enemy of the united states is a terrorist is operating in conjunction with any foreign power and it gives him ladies and gentlemen the power to name any group any organization or any person or persons to have them arrested without benefit of habeas corpus without trial without trial and to be deported out of the united states if that's what they want to do with you or to just lock you up in some dungeon somewhere where you will be forgotten forever you didn't know that well i suggest that you get oklahoma city day one because the entire text of the counterterrorism bill is printed in the appendix of that book 640 pages of the documented and sourced truth of what really happened in oklahoma city on april the 19th 1995 now well i'm not going to read it because the law is too hard to understand only if you're a complete brainless idiot who never studied english in your life and can't use a dictionary and my little eight-year-old daughter can do all of those things so how about that how about that quote the law goes on to outline a course of action for the arrested individual that in general is at odds with normal judicial procedure oh really is that a surprise he first would be given a hearing without right or bail before a preliminary hearing officer whose decision could then be appealed to a detention review board at no time though the attorney general required to furnish information the revelation of which would disclose the identity are evidence of government agents or officers which he believes it would be dangerous to national safety and security to divulge shades of adolf hitler my goodness in other words the government can decline to present any evidence whatsoever in effect transforming the traditional presumption of innocence into a presumption of guilt the burden of disproof is on the prisoner these same ground rules apply to any later review of the case by the united states court of appeals the mccarran act was passed overwhelmingly by frightened liberals and conservatives alike in both the house and senate vetoed by president truman then passed again over his veto though it was approved with the rest of the act the title ii amendment was blasted by senator pat mccarran himself as a concentration camp measure pure and simple senator carl month tagged it a program for establishing concentration camps into which people might be put without benefit of trial but merely by executive fiat simply by an assumptive mind you that an individual might be thinking about engaging in espionage or sabotage might be thinking an assumption that an individual might be thinking might be thinking might be thinking about engaging in espionage and sabotage you see ladies and gentlemen this is what i've been telling you for years quick this republican democrat all of this other baloney joke you're either for freedom or you're not if you're for big brother government and more laws and more welfare and more of this and more regulation and more licenses you are not an american if you are for freedom if you are for the disclosure of all of these secret things like this if you are poor the protection of the rights of the individual if you are for the constitution for the united states of america welcome aboard if you're not you're an enemy of the republic i don't care what you call yourself i don't care who you are and i don't care how mad this makes you i just simply don't care it just blows everybody's mind on the internet when they attack me somewhere and i send them a message back saying i just don't care what you think period who can read i understand what freedom is i understand what despotism is i understand what tyranny is and if you promote any of those things i don't care what you think i am your enemy simple as that simple as that what you think doesn't even even register a little bit on a scale of respect here i've been all over the world as a boy and as a man i've fought a war i've seen what despotism is i've seen what tyranny is i've seen what freedom is what it can be and how it's being taken away and i see how most of the american people are fooled into thinking that tyranny is freedom it's not it's not said the old north dakota dissenters senator sinator senator william langer and i quote so it is now proposed to have concentration camps in america we can be absolutely certain that the concentration camps are for only one purpose namely to put in them the kind of people those in authority do not like end quote actually there was there was a very grisly precedent for this type of mass imprisonment during world war ii the government arrested confiscated the property of and granted no hearings to our redress for the 109 650 japanese americans who were held in 10 relocation centers the united states supreme court more over unanimously upheld this action in 1943 and its decision was cited by congress in 1950 to justify america's first peacetime concentration camp measure it is now and was then and always will be unconstitutional the federal government cannot do anything more than what is granted to it by the constitution for the united states of america and that does not include concentration camps in fact in a state of emergency the only power given to the federal government by the constitution of the united states of america is the temporary suspension of habeas corpus for the duration of the emergency only period they don't have the power to suspend the constitution they don't have the power to take away any rights of the people the only power they have is to suspend temporarily during the course of the emergency only the power of the writ of habeas corpus title ii section 104 small c of the mccarran act provides that persons detained shall be confined in such places of detention as may be prescribed by the attorney general in 1952 accordingly the justice department designated six sites for the detention camp program listen very carefully go check it out camps were set up on a standby basis at allen wood pennsylvania avon park florida el reno oklahoma florence and wittenberg arizona and tule lake california so the united states does indeed so the united states does indeed so the united states does indeed have a concentration camp law as well as camp facilities to match yet both were byproducts of joe mccarthy era frenzy and neither lawn or camps have ever been put to use for emergency detention purposes but they can be the law has since been expanded ladies and gentlemen and money has been allotted by the congress to build them all over the place and they are being built and have been built and some will continue to be built don't believe me look it up look it up ladies and gentlemen what do you think about that did they get your blood boiling well it should you should be hot about this uh here's something that you uh need to understand folks our military is being reorganized and their mission is being redefined the new definition is to function toward the goals of the new world order now why isn't our military why are not our military active and retired professionals officer core enlisted men non-commissioned officers petty officers why aren't they speaking out against this radical conversion of the very purpose of having a military force could it be that they're for this i don't know the answer to that i do know that one world one world government as an answer to war is taught in all the military academies and in the naval war college and the army war college and i know that many many high-ranking officers have made statements on television and in writings and we have a huge a huge report from the naval war college outlining the future role of the united states navy in the new world order and on the front page of this report which is several inches thick is the seal of the united states navy and the seal of fema so if you're still wondering if i'm nuts when i tell you this stuff i'm not we're looking for a an inexpensive method to get this printed up so that we can offer it to all of you out there so that you can read it and some of the other things if we can find a printer that's low enough we think we may have found one in albuquerque then we will begin printing it up and making it available as inexpensive as we possibly can let me just check and see if this is carolyn or if it's uh if it's the little children again hello you're on the air hello it's not carolyn okay now remember i just read the letter from the man in prison who used to publish a newsletter called grace and he sent me a copy of his friend's newsletter called the dove and i want to read you an excerpt from this newsletter because i think it's pertinent i've been warning you about trojan horses and i've been admonishing you to weed out the freemasons who are leading the patriots movements because they are trojan horses ,2
32,xmC7QBswkqU,beautiful day beautiful day my beautiful people man i feel so bad for um a lot of these people who don't have knowledge of self because that is by far uh the best armor in these days and times living in this simulated kind of reality the matrix uh call it what you will but people who don't know kind of the full spectrum of who they actually are that's like playing a game that you don't really know the rules of it's like imagine trying to play monopoly or parcheesi or whatever the [ __ ] chess whatever board game you choose and you didn't know the rules you're gonna be frustrated you're not even going to know what's going on you might even just start slapping the chess pieces off the board um in anger and frustration and that's kind of what i see going on right now but people don't know their real self like point blank straight up and down first [ __ ] thing if you uh are bugging out over race you know they got you man like for one like listen we know that there are uh racial aspects to living but you what you also need to know is you've probably been at this point um depending on your soul age or how old how long you've been reincarnating i mean you've been every race you've been every gender so we're all gonna die we're all gonna go back into this earth and we're all human beings so bottom line race is is a separation polarizing mechanism used by um authority figures we'll just say people in control to divide people bottom line so get the [ __ ] out of here let's just stop with all that [ __ ] i'll be dead honest with you listen other times of racism and all that type of [ __ ] absolutely were they doing crazy [ __ ] back in here during the racism days absolutely do they still do crazy [ __ ] cops you know um who might have uh you know anger issues towards a certain racial group and so on and so forth does all that type of [ __ ] happen absolutely but you know what i mean people do crazy [ __ ] to people for way all types of reasons man i mean there's people who you know though they'll hate you or not like you for a for a myriad of reasons because you remind them of someone else in their past um usually it's out of fear and ignorance or that you remind them of themselves so listen man like you know people kill each other for all types of reasons people hate on each other for all types of reasons people destroy each other for all types of reasons but the real reason why all that [ __ ] goes on is self-hatred and it's in and that comes stems from a lack of knowledge of self because if you don't know yourself um you probably fear yourself which is that hatred you feel me so i need y'all to listen the [ __ ] up man because i don't really hear anyone having a clear conscience and having having really uh views that aren't like super super um tainted by their life experience or by what's going on or be or what they've been told man listen i'm gonna tell you right now this your man day uh i'm a free thinker i've always been a free thinker and i have an iq of over 140. why do i say that man listen i didn't even know i was i was anything of a gifted person or had any you know type of intellect that was above the average for years but i mean i've been tested and this looks it looks like i'm pretty good at reasoning you know i mean it doesn't mean i know everything it doesn't mean i'm some superior being it just means that i'm able to uh look at data and process it really quickly like us a brand new mac or something like that that's the way i would put it doesn't mean i'm infallible doesn't mean i'm better than you but listen i'm able to assess things i'm able to not uh look at things from a objective view probably in an interest in a different way than other people um or a lot of other people so i just want to break down what's going on here um the thing is the story is so long to start to give you the whole backdrop of of how we got here bro that's that's like godfather one through one million that's a that's a long [ __ ] movie that's a really long movie but i think i can boil it down to something that's like you know uh somewhat palatable in this little video because i've decided that i need to speak my truth too i'm tired of listening to other people man i like to listen to other people i like to gain new viewpoints but i swear to god everyone sounds like they're a [ __ ] robot they sound like the same person spitting out the same [ __ ] putting their own little twist on it and it's just fugazi as a [ __ ] just like hip-hop what i grew up in when back in the day this little side let's take a little side little trip right now back in the day in hip-hop if you sounded like somebody else that was like the wackiest [ __ ] thing you were you were ashamed you were [ __ ] booted booed off stage they threw tomatoes at you uh so to speak you know i mean and now it's like if you don't sound like another [ __ ] they're like what is this [ __ ] it's cause a bunch of rich [ __ ] white people run hip-hop man not the artists artists used to be listen listen to ultramatic ultra magnetic mcs cool keefe said g said love um [ __ ] like innovation uh you know that used to be the thing you know i mean that now it's just reduplication it says it's factory music it's factory thought and i see the same thing i see even these spiritual people on youtube i'll go back off the hip hop now we're back into what the [ __ ] i was talking about excuse you know what i mean so listen everyone is like there's a mass consciousness right and when you when you adhere to that and you and you're always swimming in that pool you can't help but be affected by it that's why i'm kind of a rake loose that's why i listen to like dub music and try not to hear people talking about [ __ ] because i feel that's what's what i did in music too like at a certain point i was a hip-hop head dr hip-hop uh you know up until 18 i listened to every [ __ ] thing i'm like an encyclopedia you know um from that from up to i was 18. when i was 18 a long [ __ ] time ago but we'll say from like you know 84 to um say like 99 like i know every [ __ ] thing that happened in hip-hop i know every [ __ ] i'm not talking about everything i don't know i know every release like if you had a demo tape bro i heard it like i know everything about hip hop in that time because i was so immersed and so submerged in that because i was i was building you know i was i was learning i was in my my student phase and i was and i was building that um that base and that foundation but then after after 18 i just stopped listening to a lot of hip-hop because i was creating it and i didn't want it to um affect my ability to innovate i didn't want to affect my ability to to to really uh reach my potential instead of just being kind of like a copy of someone else so basically that's what i see is going on now is is everyone else is kind of kicking out everyone else's rehashed ideas and um i i like to you know pull back and i like to meditate on things and i like to kind of see if i can receive something from the universe and get maybe a clear perspective but anyway listen man i don't want to take you all time too much man i'm probably going to start doing this a lot more but um you know what's going on right now man is basically there's a whole obviously there's a lot of you know uh self-hate going on and that's what you're not gonna hear yes like people you know do not like the government you know they don't like corporations lying to them and stealing from them and credit card rates and and police brutality but you have to understand that you know humanity has a part to play in its own enslavement we're the ones that allowed all of this to happen um not me personally because you know me i'm a [ __ ] recluse and i do my own thing but i'll say something real controversial right now people out there writing right they're writing because they don't like the system but by far the the easiest way to stop the system is to stop investing in it you know i mean y'all want to destroy [ __ ] tear [ __ ] down but you pay your taxes on time don't you so you're funding your own demise all right i'm not gonna get too deep into that one because i don't want any knock knock knocks but anyway um bottom line is is like you know most people they they they are funding their own demise and they are you know they have a part to play in their own ignorance you know you give your kids away to the public school system which was developed by the rockefellers and you know they're going to teach you what they want to teach you they're going to teach you how to be a good little nine to five slave they're going to teach you how to fit into their system but unless you're like of that artistic entrepreneur mind that free thinker mind you're a farmer you're you're a manufacturer you know how to create unless you unless you know about about that you know um whole process of you know providing a service or providing a good and that's how you really get money because this whole economy now is based on mostly um service and fraudulent service and debt financing corporations these corporations aren't even making a profit they just are defrauding investors they're getting lots of upfront capital and then they're continuing on in that manner for years and years and years just like the consumer who's paying off their extravagant credit card debt you know i mean for stuff that they bought 10 years ago and they're still just paying off the interest but anyway man listen you know people people have not taken uh their own expansion their own um their own minds they haven't looked into themselves deep enough and become autonomous and and realize that listen like there's a system out there that was not made for you was made for them it was made for the controllers the rulers the obliges who just want to have like their their little worker bees working for them in their system you know but if you know if you want to be empowered then you have to take you know that initiative and you have to find out who you are you have to realize that you've been lied to you have to realize there's fluoride in the water you have to realize politicians don't love you you have to realize that it's a it's a polarizing game republican democrat black and white rich poor they're trying to divide and conquer they're trying to separate you they're very good at it it's very believable but once you step outside of that of that uh you know show going on you realize what it is you can see all the cameras you can see all the actors you're like oh man this [ __ ] is fake as [ __ ] this [ __ ] is not really organic life this whole thing is contrived and it's not for my benefit what do you mean is fluoride which is a neurotoxin in my toothpaste why what what the [ __ ] is going on uh what what do you mean all these presidents they have they come from the same bloodline i thought it was like a democratic process you know i mean but you people have been lied to you've been lied to since day one i mean if you go back and watch the movie the matrix like that [ __ ] is more fact than it is fiction but that's what's going on is you're living in a simulated reality that they created for them that's what they're calling civilization you know and and you see the manifestation of that you see all the hatred which stems from self-hatred people oh i'm gonna break up this store i wanna loot [ __ ] i wanna rob [ __ ] i wanna destroy the society i don't like it but you know the change always starts from within you have to be that cell because we're all creating this mass consciousness you have to be that that complete strong cell for this foundation to continue to grow and for things to be stable in society and it's all good to like you know sometimes you have to tear down and and um you know burn things down so you can start starting new like a forest fire or whatever um and and the forest comes back even more lush but when you don't have a consciousness behind what you're doing there's that japanese proverb that says you know um i think it says action uh you know that says something to the effect of of um you know thinking without action is is it is a daydream but action without thinking is a nightmare so when you're acting and you don't really know what the [ __ ] you're mad about and why you're acting and you just have all this pent up rage and frustration you're gonna go and tear [ __ ] down where there's gonna be energetic consequences for that i mean every action has an equal and opposite so you're going out you busting cops upside the head guess what's gonna happen to you bro you're gonna get bust upside your head it doesn't stop there what happens if you go on you you know you you uh beat up you know some dude what happens maybe his friends come back and beat you up and maybe if it's not his friends you still have that karma you have that energetic debt on you and so all that all this destruction you know it's not leading for good these people that are telling you this is a consciousness expansion that's that's wishful thinking i wish that was true but right now we're still on the downward slope we have a hit rock bottom it hasn't even got close we haven't even seen the effects of this economic depression to hit when you're gonna see regular folks who had you know decent jobs on this on the streets it's gonna get real funky man and i just felt like i should let some people know who probably are like me out there when i try to find someone you know with a clear conscience speaking about these matters i see little tidbits of here and there some people who are able to articulate it but mostly people don't have the full spectrum view they're usually like i said they're kind of more tainted by their past and their background and they don't they don't really see things uh unobjectively and i feel like i can do that man because it's like um and i feel like i can speak for you know a lot of people out there i know what it's like to be [ __ ] up in the game and i know i know the mindset of these [ __ ] looters man i know what it's like to hate yourself to to not see any opportunity to feel like the system is rigged you just want to tear [ __ ] the [ __ ] down but that's not it man you might catch one in the noodle you know you might get [ __ ] up you know i mean you might get in jail you know a lot of things can happen to you that are just going to further that negative causality chain of events and that's just not it man you know i mean looting macy's is not going to get you prosperity and it's not going to get you peace of mind and it's not going to get you stability and it's not going to make you feel good about yourself and you're still going to go out like a [ __ ] sucker you know i mean so i don't know really where i'm going with this but i just need to let y'all know that you're being played by george soros he's riots or fake as [ __ ] people rioting over dude like is as gruesome as that [ __ ] was to watch on on you know tape you have to recognize that there's karma out there there's other things going on out there how many of y'all did your homework and knew that that dude held a pregnant lady at gunpoint and put a gun to her belly okay and now you held someone against your will maybe she couldn't breathe with that gun in her belly and maybe she was had so much [ __ ] anxiety and fear at that moment that she she couldn't even breathe and now this dude has a knee on his neck saying i can't breathe but just think about that i'm not saying this right but i'm saying the universe you know it has his own way of dealing with certain things not only did he do a home invasion and hold somebody at gunpoint you know i mean the dude has been arrested several times per for possession of cocaine and all that [ __ ] and have there been police injustices and yeah but how come people didn't ride out for someone who was truly an innocent person this dude had something to do with his own demise once again you're high on fentanyl you're dropping little white baggies out you've been to jail several times several bids not just the five years for home invasion of a pregnant lady all right not just that but [ __ ] cocaine multiple times come on man and that's who your painting murals of yeah i mean you know you need to think about [ __ ] more before you go and start calling somebody your homie i'm i'm gonna say right now you ain't did your homework that's your man that's your man you know about your man you knew your man was a cokehead you know your man was drunk as [ __ ] high on fentanyl passing off fake 20s yeah i mean that doesn't mean you deserve to die but that also does not mean you deserve to be martyred [ __ ] out of here real talk stop that there there's other people who have been like you know unfairly targeted and and slain and maimed and murdered black white puerto rican hawaiian all types of [ __ ] people all types of incidents that you could have choose to you know uh set off a a um you know a protest and and a statement for but the truth is is this is not organic this was done by george soros this wasn't done by black people completely outraged yeah they probably would have had some little thing in minneapolis or you know uh a protest in minneapolis and been outraged because it was a local thing but this has been happening and then this dude you know unfortunately he's drunk and high and and he knew that cop apparently they worked at the security the same thing i don't know what's going on man but it's some [ __ ] it's contrived it's meant to get a reaction out of you and it's not organic man so eat organic think organic pull away from this [ __ ] you need to clear your mind because they're trying to drive same people crazy they're trying to make uh sad people angry and they're basically trying to create as much confusion and and distraction as possible because that's that's they get order out of chaos and that's what the [ __ ] is going on man so if you want more clear minded rational thinking from someone who's been through it who's been from the hood and who was ascending and who has done the dark spiritual work done that dark dirty [ __ ] to see your your dark side and now has been able to kind of like you know i'm not i'm nobody i'm nobody's guru i'm nobody's coach but i'll tell you right now man is is i'm a survivor and i'm a fighter and i'm a lover and i got some ideas and i'm an intelligent person very intelligent reasoning reasonable logical person and um if you want more clear insights man [ __ ] with your man day you already know what it is you already know i can wrap my ass off but did you know did you know that i got some thoughts to share [ __ ] with me oh no ,3
33,27QlHF369ZU,denver colorado is home to america's largest airport called the denver new world airport the airport was built by freemasons in 1995 and features a free masonic dedication capstone in the atrium a time capsule is buried underneath the stone to be opened in the year 2094. the new world denver airport has a swastika-shaped runway there is reportedly a deep underground military base beneath the airport with miles and miles of secret subterranean tunnels connected to a large network of underground cities as passengers drive up to the main airport terminal they are greeted by a sinister looking 32 foot high fiberglass blue stallion with veins popping out of its body and demonic eyes that glow bright red not exactly a common influence for travelers who are already spooked about getting on a plane the sculpture is believed to symbolize the pale horse of the apocalypse mentioned in the bible whose name is death the sculptor luis jimenez was killed by the horse when a chunk of the sculpture broke loose and came crashing down on him locals call the horse lucifer inside the airport travelers hurry past grotesque gargoyles in suitcases that leer down at them and morbid apocalyptic murals that line the airport walls at the main gate four panels of giant-sized wall murals in the baggage claim area tell a terrifying and prophetic story and pictures of how humanity's future is going to unfold the first mural reveals a horrific darth vader-like figure wearing a nazi general uniform and a gas mask the gas mask indicates that the next war will use depopulating biological or chemical agents the white dove that he is killing symbolizes peace on the right are destroyed buildings reminiscent of the twin towers the nazi general scimitar sword has been swished through the air leaving behind a rainbow chemtrail that poisons the air and ethnic population below it on the left is an endless line of weeping women refugees holding dead babies there is no trace whatsoever of violence to the dead children who appear to have died from the deadly gas of the toxic rainbow why are there no men present presumably they have all been killed the nazi general scimitar sword that destroys peace is a symbol used by the shriners who are freemasons freemasonry is a fraternity within a fraternity outwardly it is a friendly charitable organization that conceals an inner brotherhood of the 33rd degree elect the next airport mural shows a forest and a city in flames the world's endangered animals and plants are extinct buffaloes whales leopards elephants and sea turtles the sickly haze and leaping flames suggest a nuclear or biochemical devastation children are the only survivors and they are weeping over three open caskets of an african girl on the left a native girl in the center and a white judeo-christian girl on the right they represent the death of the old black red and white root races to make way for the new world race the dead white girl in the coffin holds a bible and a yellow judean star which was used by the nazis to identify jews it symbolizes the death of judeo-christian beliefs another child holds a mayan tablet depicting the end of the mayan calendar and the end of the world as we know it in the third mural the apocalyptic war has ended children of all nations are joyfully giving up their nation's sovereignty to the blond-haired blue-eyed german boy at the center they are all turning over their weapons wrapped in their country's national flag to the german boy the bavarian jacket leaves no doubt whatsoever that the blond-haired blue-eyed boy is german he symbolizes the bavarian illuminati with an iron fist the german boy destroys the weapons of war symbolized by the nazi general sword the german boy uses a hammer which symbolizes the hammer and sickle of communism in the foreground the nazi general is dead with doves of peace perched on his corpse the german boy symbolizes a world leader and savior who brings peace through communism to a devastated world who is this boy that the world gives up their flags and weapons to we know he is german with blonde hair and blue eyes like prince william who posed as a boy for this papua new guinea stem prince william's father is the son of prince philip and queen elizabeth whose surnames were changed to cover up their german identities prince william's mother diana was allegedly the daughter of james goldsmith a german jew in the fourth mural the earth is restored including the endangered species the land and water this future world is populated not by adults but by parentless children what happened to the adults the children are in a dance line that is led by the scottish boy who symbolizes scottish rite freemasonry also on the far left is an african woman carrying a snake banner the parentless children of the world are celebrating the new world religion as they gather around and touch the light of lucifer who appears as a genetically engineered plant the plant is a floral version of the colorful bird known as the quetzalcoatl or feathered serpent it is symbolically inseparable from the morning star and lucifer the main theme of the denver new world airport murals is an apocalypse with massive depopulation extinction of species the death of judeo-christian beliefs and the birth of one world government one world ruler and one world religion ,2
34,78fHed2ciZY,hi guys thank you for joining me back here again on the 401 files it's an absolute pleasure to have you here on such a beautiful day today the sun is shining the sky is blue i've got lily running around here somewhere like a headless chicken i've been hearing her chasing pheasants and no doubt wildman but um i just thought i'd sit here and talk to you guys take five minutes to enjoy this beautiful day and talk to you guys about the men in black subject this fascinated me for years for many different reasons i'm going to dive into them really quickly now and share them with you but please do chip in let me know what your thoughts and theories are on the men in black because i don't know everything and it's always interesting to know what you guys think so all around the world many people have had experiences with ufos extraterrestrials talk about these experiences shortly after with these weird beings these weird humans on the surface of things that don't quite look right something's a bit off about them and often they use very forceful tactics often they're very threatening um and and pushy they tell people if they want to see their children again that they should keep their mouth shut if they want to arrive at work on monday morning then they should never speak about this again um so who are these men and black guys who are they all the reports that i've heard of these men in black say the same thing they're extremely tall people pale skin slender build and completely bald they have no facial stubble no eyelashes no eyebrows and no hair on their head so if we say that the government are employing these beans to keep the ufo phenomena under wraps does that mean that the government are employing only bald identical twins because that's what it would have to mean and the reason it would have to be nice because this isn't happening to one person in one local area this is happening all over the world to hundreds of different people we have this woman here in australia talking about these pale hairless identical twins threatening her then over here in the uk somebody's saying the same then over in sweden and russia they're all over the world is it just one pair of twins traveling all around the world threatening people i highly doubt it is it the government just hiring bald identical twins i highly doubt it so then we have to ask ourselves what is going on because that's a very strange description that keeps occurring time and time again of these people using threatening behavior are they extraterrestrial this is the most likely theory in my opinion because gary mckinnon a very famous person here in the uk was a hacker who hacked into nasa's database and he pulled forward a folder that was titled non-terrestrial officers now in that list of non-terrestrial officers gary went through the names um one after the other and he couldn't find anything to suggest that these were humans in orbit no names all these ones are astronauts the folder was titled non-terrestrial officers he then found another folder called ship-to-ship transfers instinctively gary thought that this must mean naval ships but when he ran the name through no naval ships belonged anywhere to any fleet on this planet so what does that mean non-terrestrial officers and ship to ship transfers sounds very extraterrestrial to me and very alien indeed so that has me thinking about the men in black i know that dan aykroyd made a documentary a few years back about his ufo experiences and his interest in the ufo phenomenon but in that documentary he also mentioned his experience with the men in black and how strange that was for him and how that kind of all in his perception on who they were but i'm just curious guys what do you think do you think the men in black are humans that are employed by the government who just happen to be bald identical twins that to me seems very unlikely and hilariously funny if that is what their job description entails oh yeah just if you want the position you've got to be identical ball twins otherwise you can't start monday morning that sounds very far-fetched and ridiculous so then the other options are that the government are working alongside extraterrestrials to keep people quiet about the ufo phenomenon now that one sounds my favorite of the bunch and then we could go even one step further and say are the government extraterrestrials this is something that david talks about that sounds very far-fetched and out there but who knows if if we have the government who we supposedly believe a human working with extraterrestrials then why stop there who's to say the government actually thresholds i'll be fascinated tonight you guys think on this and the men in black like i said the men in black theory or the men in black subject is very fascinating indeed and these don't seem like they're very nice people in a lot of these situations they threaten people with their life their children's life and um they're hell bent they're hell-bent on keeping the ufo extraterrestrial phenomena silent and out of the public domain you guys let me know what you think it's been an absolute pleasure to get out on this glorious day sit by this tree and chat to you about the topics that we all love to talk about take it easy guys stay safe wherever you're in the world and until next time i will see you on the next one ,3

37,64bqwkNMm_g,was i wrong for the last four and a half years i've been predicting that donald trump would become the biblical antichrist of revelation 13. i explained all my reasons verse by verse through revelation 13 and then monitored the news during his administration just waiting for the day when something would trigger him to be possessed by satan like judas iscariot was and turn into the antichrist persecuting christians and destroying churches all around the world was i wrong about that since the time of my first prediction video i found myself constantly defending him as being the greatest u.s president we've ever had i kept saying he's not the antichrist yet and i hope it never actually happens that wish might have come true but at what expense i predicted that he would easily win re-election by an even bigger landslide than the first time and yes it was a landslide the first time once you recognize all the dnc's failed attempts to steal it from him but here we are in 2021 and he's no longer commander-in-chief that must mean i was wrong right well i sure hope so but not so fast he's not dead yet there are still multiple ways for my prediction to come true even if it takes several more years to finally happen but first let's look at what i hope actually happened here many people were comparing trump to king cyrus because he moved the u.s embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem recognizing jerusalem as the official capital of israel i admit i see the parallel but i'd like to present another biblical parallel that might make sense too during the divided kingdom of israel and judah in the old testament all the various kings were described as being either good or bad all of them in israel were bad but many of them in judah were good the last good one was named josiah he was even prophesied by name to come before he was even born josiah did a lot of good things fighting against the evil of his day but ultimately he ended up being killed when he went up against an egyptian pharaoh who was trying to war against assyria he came in between two warring factions that he had nothing to do with and paid the price and as of his death the rest of the kings of judah were all bad and babylon eventually conquered judah now that was god's plan all along even though josiah is described as the best king they ever had it was already too late for judah because of all the evil that the previous kings had done there was no way for josiah to turn back the wrath that god had planned for judah they had a temporary moment of goodness in the land of judah a revival if you will under king josiah but the hammer was still about to fall no matter what assyria defeated the northern tribes of israel egypt took out king josiah and babylon was about to wipe out judah as a nation so what's the parallel here if donald trump never returns to power then i see him as our king josiah before our final destruction he did a lot of good and truly made america great again in many ways my previous videos outline all of that but he was up against a worldly power that he didn't fully understand and truly underestimated the newest term for it seems to be the deep state but there's many other names you could call them the depths of their evil goes lower than any average person could imagine hollywood movies tell some of the stories and make you think it's just fiction but it's not the people who make a lifestyle of unspeakable evil will go to any length to achieve their goals and trump got in their way america has been plagued with corruption in its highest places for a long time now longer than any of us know longer than any of us has even been alive there was corruption in the original founding in 1776 there was corruption during the civil war there was corruption during world war one world war ii the vietnam war 911 afghanistan iraq syria are you starting to see a pattern yet the devil loves war there's a lot of money to be made from war and certain bankers centuries ago learned how to finance both sides of the wars so that everyone is indebted to them this is nothing new the people who control the money control the world so when some billionaire comes in and takes over their finely tuned machine they needed to get rid of him however they can hillary wasn't able to steal it from him the washington insiders weren't able to turn him to the dark side the porn star accusations didn't work comey wasn't able to frame him the russian collusion hoax didn't work the phone call impeachment didn't work and every assassination attempt that nobody publicly knows about failed i'm surprised he made it through his entire four-year term and these people are so crazy they tried to impeach him a second time after he was already out of office why because they don't want him coming back again ever but will he it sure seems pretty obvious that he'll run again in 2024 i don't think his age will be a factor at all and can you imagine how upset they will be if he comes back again and somehow despite all their fraudulent attempts wins the 2024 election i mean their fraud was so blatant in 2020 just think how blatant their assassination attempt will be in 2024 or 2025 they won't care who knows they've mastered the art of plausible deniability they'll set some oswald up to take the fall but that would then put my prediction back right back on track but what if he doesn't run what if he dies well then i guess i was wrong and i'll be glad about that but here's the thing somebody is going to become the antichrist eventually i don't see the guy currently in office becoming the antichrist he can barely talk i don't see him ever claiming to be god and his second in command is into man and i believe scripture describes the antichrist as a man so will the antichrist come out of the deep state someone we don't know yet they certainly are anti-christian enough that's for sure but i just can't see the majority of people willingly bowing down to anyone in the deep state and it seems the antichrist will be loved by everyone well almost everyone we christians will never accept him now how about this what if i was wrong about which trump it would be the bible mentions the last trump which means there was a first trump yes i believe that's talking about the seven trumpets of revelation but still if donald trump is a parallel of josiah maybe it's the children of donald trump who end up being a parallel to josiah's evil children my eye is obviously on don jr but who knows at this point my expected timeline has been interrupted what if it's eric what if it's barren that i have to doubt because he wouldn't be eligible to become president until 2045 and considering jesus was here around 32 a.d i'm also expecting his return to be approximately 2 000 years later at the most so who knows maybe the winner of the 2028 election is our future antichrist will it be someone named trump will it be don junior's second term hmm just keep watching people ,2
38,o9P0eLdlLbg,[Music] welcome nasa is one of the most important space agencies that study space sciences planets stars and galaxies scientists were able to capture many pictures videos and sounds of many cosmic phenomena and things that happen in space but despite this this agency was able to learn many secrets that it tried to hide from the whole world as she did not want anyone to know any of these secrets which would certainly not be in their interest but first our esteemed viewers supported us with admiration for the video and subscribing to the channel until all new arrives from us 10th the transmission is interrupted nasa is working to publish a live broadcast of everything that is happening in space and many of these transmissions are pictures of our planet earth from space but in many times the company stopped this transmission for some hidden reasons it is said that the time when nasa does this thing happens when strange things appear on the screen in space it also increases in excitement and mystery when the company tries to justify the reasons for the cut the most popular reason to respond to such situations is that the transmission has failed but anyone who is loyal to the conspiracy theory say that the reason that led to the cut off the transmission as a reason other than that stated by nasa ninth recording of the landing on the moon's surface in the 20th of the year 1969 this day has been classified as one of the most important days in human history as it is on this day that man was able for the first time in history to ascend on the surface of the moon the most famous astronauts who were able to make this trip honol armstrong strangely enough these recordings made from the surface of the moon she disappeared from the archives at nasa but there are some of these moments on the nasa website however some believe that the reason why these recordings were deleted from the archive was for private purposes eighth the paper clip operation if you studied anything about the history of the 20th century you might have heard of a conference known as operation paper dog it is said that this conference took place after the end of world war ii this conference was attended by many scholars and experts among them was one of those scholars who was able to make masts and who was known only bernard brown he was providing many rockets to nasa in the beginning this is what surprised many people when they realized that the agency had german assets after nasa achieved many achievements he erased any paper confirming that it had been in contact with this association seventh the remains confirm the existence of a civilization on mars mars is one of the most important planets in the entire solar galaxy as many scientists are interested in monitoring it and knowing all the natural and environmental phenomena that occur in it it certainly contains many secrets that have not been revealed so far one of the wonderful discoveries that the cement agency was able to discover in november of the year 2000 and it was by this robot that was roaming the entire earth of mars it is this thing that is said to date back to a civilization that was based on mars it means that the nas agency often tries to hide many of the things that it discover in space from humans this confirms that there are many mysterious things that humans do not know yet sixth a strange base on the surface of the moon the moon that orbits around the planet earth is considered one of the strangest celestial bodies that exist in space which scientists are always trying to discover its secrets completely indeed in june of the year 2009 scientists were able to capture this strange picture that was appearing on it a strange base on the surface of the moon like this and what nasa concealed about this made many people believe in conspiracy theories which says that aliens are already living in the galaxy in which we live and the scientists who work for nasa lie this thing fifth a ufo near the sun the sun is considered a celestial body and a star that no planet in this galaxy in which we live can abandon it it is also distinguished by its unique characteristics and features and scientists are always trying to search for these secrets and once in a while the nasa satellite could take this photo of this ufo near the sun this made many scientists try to find an explanation as to what type of object was able to get so close to the sun what was the goal that pushed him to reach this place and who sent it that is why this image was hidden from the whole world but later it was published fourth the engine of the x-37b plane this plane is considered one of the strange accidents that happened at nasa which no scientist has been able to explain until now wear this jet which looks like a rocket is sent into space in order to discover many mysterious things but it turns out that this plane is able to go up to the moon while scientists previously stated that it is not possible to climb onto the moon using planes but rather that missiles must be used after the success of this operation this aircraft was not mentioned in any of the records this data has been completely erased third a secret mission in africa not many people know this thing but nasa has already carried out many secret missions in africa and this is for purposes that not many people know this happened in the year 2014 where many aircraft and missiles were tested in order to find out their capacity but many supporters of conspiracy theories said that nasa was doing this thing in order to prepare for war but until now no one knows the main purpose of this secret mission in africa second a strange picture taken on the moon space residents are one of the mysterious things that many people try to prove their presence in this world in which we live that is why when anyone is able to discover anything it confirms to us the existence of aliens plenty to try to prove this thing is real the aliens live with us in this world indeed an agency discovered many photos and videos confirming this thing but she hid it from the world you can be sure of this thing by looking at this person who appears in this picture which made it a strange picture that has no explanation but the strange thing is that nasa has hidden it which means that it is aware of something that it does not want anyone to know at all first and foremost nuclear tests on the surface of the moon the soviet union often quarreled with the united states of america over who was in control of space it prompted some of them to conduct nuclear tests on the surface of the moon but this is what nasa resorted to and it is considered a black point in its great history until now she is trying to erase anything she owes to this thing in her history until now trying to hide it from people dear viewers we have reached the end of the video what surprised you most today in this video as well as you did not know him before let us know in the comments and don't forget to like the video and subscribe to the channel ,3
39,HbfAeLH7UlM,[Music] [Music] my [Music] [Music] hello my friends hello everybody welcome and thank you this is ghosha from cosmic agency and today i'm going to have a very interesting and very exciting chat video with you uh which we did with uh rashel yes this is going to be the conversation that i had with robert with rashel now i'm gonna have to explain to you who rachel is okay so as you know except for um apart from zwaru um there are a lot of targeted people up there in the orbit and beyond that and rachel you would say is um is a is a type of ambassador uh ambassador between taigata and the federation between taigata and other races and also um kind of targeting federation ambassador for the earth she will explain that she has been here since 1952 she's there she's the one that has been here the longest so she knows our affairs she was here during the times of the war uh yes and you understand why even though i just said that she came in 1952 um and she is the one attention i know it's hard to believe but um if we assume that they are who they say they are and we of course do um so this is this is just incredible she's the one that has talked to president eisenhower yes and now in this video i'm going to explain well i'm not going to explain that russia will explain how they were involved with real society and who maria or sikh is yes she will explain the link between them and the real society okay i want to make it um i want to speed it up a little bit i would just tell you that it's basically them they have participated in this project it was their project they traveled back in time it will be explained in the video i'm just gonna give you like a short summary so you know what this is about uh real society was a secret um occult well not so maybe secret but occult esoteric society in nazi germany and maria rusik was the german german so they said a lady who claimed to have extraterrestrial communication with the beings that supposedly are from aldebaran so she founded this society she was the leader of the real society and whose members whose members and you can find this online this is not rashely's information this is general knowledge whose members were young and attractive women yes young and attractive mysterious women with very very long hair and they had this hair to maintain their telepathic communication as antennas and um they were providing germans interesting information the germans were very interested were passionate about being the best at everything especially technologically so once they found out about maria and about the the contact she had with those extraterrestrials and about the information that she was providing they got very interested so she was um i i from what i think um providing them with a lot of information she was also giving them the technology how to construct the ships but now they were not the ladies were not cooperating with the german nazis they were not actually aiding them with anything that's another maybe distortion of what what has happened and rashel will explain that too what happened was that they planned to alter to influence some events within the german nazi society so they don't continue with their nuclear weapon developments and in some way they were successful so it will be explained in the video um what's really interesting that in 1945 maria orsik and other members of the society mysteriously disappeared and you can see it in the wikipedia it just says disappeared they just disappeared their bodies were never found and um just there was one note that maria left and that note said no one stays here or no one is here and that's all that's all no one has ever heard from them ever since they mysteriously appeared and they mysteriously disappeared so now you'll see in this video what happened and who they really were and now if this is real let's assume i know there are some people who may not believe this communication who may not believe our source it's okay but now let's take this for a second let's pause for a second if they really are who they say they are and they are the ones who are the members of the real society they are the ones who talk to president eisenhower then the magnitude of this information and of this contact and of this information is just huge i get shivers just thinking about this because sometimes i maybe forget about it and then i sit down and i make myself realize wait a second what's happening who am i who have i just spoken to are they for real is this really what has happened is this really who they say they are it's amazing it's crazy but you'll see everything is very coherent everything makes sense uh this is real i truly believe it um everything just is just falls into place listening to these messages not only from svarup but now also from rochelle um so i'm gonna leave you with a video no further comments from me this is gonna be part one and in the second part of this video of chats with rachel and she will explain her encounter with the president eisenhower and what happened and in the in her words this is the first time she has been explaining publicly to the world what has happened i'm just relating what she said so i'm gonna leave you with a video enjoy and until next time bye before continuing i must tell you that i do not have detailed information about the earth from the surface perspective that zvaru does nor do i speak so many languages nor do i have the same expanded perspective of the astral world that she does but i do have my own experience and i am open to what you need and do not need my present crew is not qualified they do not speak any language or few do it is not the focus or the purpose of this specific ship zvaro told us that you were her mentor she spoke very well of you yes i've been her teacher and instructor but now i am her student and another thing that i want to clarify svarug has said that she does not represent taigeta much less the federation and that she only represents herself with me it is the opposite i officially represent taigeta here as a member of the higher council of taigeta and also as a representative of taigeta before the federation i also represented here it's exactly my job and my role here you can interpret my position here with human terminology as an ambassador ambassador between the race and civilization of tagueta and the other races present here also ambassador between target and earth the videos that people are uploading with requests for assistance to the federation and benevolent races is that useful zvarus said that yes a lot they take them into account it helps a lot because it's not only the federation that listens also the other positive groups such as the sphere alliance the council of five council of nine among others what is the council of five and nine that is new for me i thought there are only two factions federation and spheres all know there are so many factions that it's impossible to understand it's just enough to know if they are positive or not that is known only by their frequency those two that you mentioned are the biggest but there are more in all this do the earth agarthians have any role agartha is officially part of the federation what happens with them is that they have so many problems as a race that they no longer work as members they are part of the problem to be solved on earth i understand rachelle and do you like this post it has to be quite difficult yes it's a demanding position quite frustrating many times because the interaction between different races is very complicated just because they are positive races doesn't mean that they always get along well because there are confusions the most recurrent one is between races called cold and logical and emotional temperamental ones it is a diplomatic nightmare i understand rachel taking advantage of the time you are here with us now in what year did you come exactly as tightens in 1952 yes and why what has caused your arrival that year and were you present on that expedition already i arrived to the orbit of earth in the year of 1952 as part of the first expedition of taigeta as a reaction to the atomic tests and the campaign of federation and its friends ships being shot down in those years and earlier i was part of the crew of the first big ship here as a counselor it was my first expedition to earth but i had experience elsewhere ships being shut down can you say something more about that please the two ships of roswell and aztec are publicized but during the 40s to the 70s about 40 ships of diverse origins were shot down none of taigeta who shot them down the ships like the two of roswell were shot down with the use of directed microwaves coming from the military raiders this fully on purpose the microwave energy interferes with the sensors of some ships blinding their computers it does not allow them to know the exact frequency of the gravitational flow in which the ship is located causing errors with gravity cancellation systems resulting in crashes those ships were mostly shot down by the americans and their allies but also by the russians later there are many casualties of extraterrestrial beings in these ships the purpose was to recover et technology right it's correct but those et ships weren't prepared for this and didn't have protection systems so that it would not happen didn't they have some sort of alert system now they do but back then they did not have it or not all races taigeta yes we had it but the ships of taigeta unlike those used by many other races have multiple modes or propulsion systems if one fails the others come in the two ships of zeta reticuli shot down in roswell for example only operated with propulsion of manipulation and cancellation of gravity you said they were russians and americans who shot them down but they were russians and americans in the sense that it was the cabal the reptiles or pure humans it's kabal and it also operated from russia the cold war was fabricated they controlled both sides you want to say that those ets thought that on earth we were all saints no saints no way rather they thought the humans were more primitive technologically speaking that articulate wow from what i understand they are the beings that lost their connection with the source and had some evil plan for the humans i have read it somewhere i am afraid it's not true in any case it would refer to the grace of orion not the reticuli and everyone has a connection with the source the source understands both the positive and the negative because it does not judge it just is judging is only property of incarnated beings with limited points of attention this the words of zvaru zetta reticuli are small positive grays that many call gardeners zeta reticuli are the gardeners then just to clarify among other places yes mostly zetta orients are negative zeta reticuli are the positive gardeners whose mission is to take care of the biology of a planet or planets gardeners everyone is positive it can be said that they work for the source only nowadays orion has already changed a lot and they are very positive now but that transition excludes the grays they are called maitre and are known as tall grays it is believed that they are the biological creation of the orion reptiles i must also say that there are at least 165 different races or types of greys the maitre are in mars right they have dominated one third of mars and they are on earth in the bases underground they collaborate with the reptiles and the cabal rachel according to your negotiations with the us government who is above the pyramid i do not see fit to publish that information at this time i understand thanks rachel the earth is dominated by these races is there some kind of treaty for which the earth has lost all its sovereignty there are many treaties some are thousands of years old new treaties were made in the 1930s by nazi germany and in the 1950s by the americans also under nazi control in the 50s eisenhower made a treaty to exchange technology for freedom to exploit the human population abductions and experiments among other things that is to say that eisenhower was part of the cabal sincerely we still do not understand his role inside the cabal because on the one hand he seems to be inside with them but on the other one he also seems to have alerted the population and the government of cabal's problems and dangers yes it was he who made that treaty although the nazis had also done it by 1937. well if he signed this treaty there are no excuses for this yes unfortunately it was he who accepted it at this point how do you want to move forward with the subject well we could ask you more about the eisenhower or i would prefer to ask more about the current situation related to the liberation of the earth because eisenhower that's the past in some sense and maybe we can talk about it later okay although everything is intriguingly related in this case explain this relation please if you wish i do not understand much about politics and i'm sure that's the reason why i do not see the links between things like you do it's okay let's go little by little and in parts okay then let's return to the beginning before eisenhower you have arrived in 1952. and what happened what was your discovery and how have you assessed the situation on earth at that time an alert was received from the entire federation because of what happened since the second world war specifically because of the detonation of nuclear weapons it is known that a nuclear detonation passes or affects several existential dimensions or planes at the same time it is termed here scalar but it can differ in meaning on earth the races that are most similar to the human race have always been closer intervening more than those that are not therefore it was up to taigeta upon examining the situation from the orbit we tried to send two crews of hunting ships called sandclock to the 30s to divert stop the nazi development that triggered the second world war and the development of nuclear weapons the sand clock cruise went from 1952 to 1937 and interacted with the nazis time travel yes the hunting ships with sand clock capacity travel in time look at this video that's us maria orsic is tigerton yes once again the true story has been distorted and it seems like we collaborate with them the nazis when we are trying to divert the events we try to alter the history are these drawings or photos they are drawings from photos maria orsik was actually savia of era i do not think i'm in those photos there although i was there she was the leader of the expedition and yes it was possible to stop the progress of the german investigations on nuclear bombs the advancement of the nazi heavy water laboratories was halted so the mission was successful zvaru always said that the collective timeline cannot be changed partially successful and the mission was only partially successful and not totally successful for reasons later explained by zvaru of era also a fighter pilot with sand clock qualifications but the mission was necessary it was necessary to intervene and infiltrate the german society of the time and with our appearance it was not difficult just you or many more tigertons two crews of 7 14 in total two ships men and women how long have you stayed and 3d didn't affect you we did not stay for more than two weeks and we were going back only to come back again the 3d hurts us we cannot be there long without getting sick it must be disgusting and toxic to be here right how does it feel to be in 3d coming from 5d it feels doughy all over you feel sick and slow the gravity is very strong and makes you feel very weak everything smells everything affects you the energy is very low it feels like walking in water up to your thighs you walk with difficulty you need a lot of recovery and sleep after being in 3d only for a short time and it affects you mentally it is depressing it lowers the vibration you can start to manifest negative things because of it [Music] the rhythm of history would have changed a lot without your intervention according to zvaru the result would be the same if the germans had the bomb first because germany lost the war but the nazi won they only emigrated to the united states okay and how have you managed to do this intervention despite all the laws of non-interferences what did the federation say in this case the federation accepted the intervention of the san clock cruise in the 30s up to the year 45 because it was only a surgical mission and the legal justification for the intervention was based on stopping the use of nuclear energy in general not only for war purposes this cancelled many subsections of non-intervention and is the primary cause of the mass arrival of the federation from the year 52 on nuclear energy in human hands is the basis of what keeps us here until these days okay thank you i would like to know if we can share all this rashel you are welcome yes everything can be shared unless we agree otherwise about one or another topic if you want to share about who i am i must give you another piece of information that will be interesting to you i am half tightened by mother and half antarian by father i was born in temer but both cultures are mine antarian and how are they what is the difference between them and tigetans unlike many other races ontario can procreate with taigeta very few can we are basically the same race only tightens are mostly blonde in appearance and have blue or green eyes ontarians usually have dark hair very white skin and mostly green eyes and everything that describes taigeta also applies to ontario the differences are small that's why they are compatible my hair is dark brown my skin is white and my eyes are green i am one meter 60 centimeters tall i see myself as a 25 year old woman as a reference and i was born in the terrestrial year calculated of 1832 on may 20th how nice i identify a lot with people with white skin and dark hair more than blondes zvaru told us without saying it openly that here humans are not very handsome your dna is not fully activated you are a caricature of your true physique that would be the correct interpretation of your creative intention as souls to incarnate also most of the humans are sick and age there as a consequence of the linear perception of time we are walking caricatures what a pity well it is what it is what's important is accepting our shortcomings here there is no other way and to know that we are more and that this is just our temporary suit svaru says it's part of the experience of the teaching that comes from being there yes we experience being ugly and defective she said it's for the contrast too to have the experience of becoming complete afterwards it's true yes rashel how do you feel talking to us tired swaru gets tired sometimes talking to many people at once no i find you very nice and i feel a lot of familiarity i was tense yesterday but not anymore if you want we'll leave it for today rachelle and no worries you can always share anything with us we are very open and tolerant and no longer so nervous talking to you we feel as if talking to a friend zvaruh tried everything at once and mostly succeeded like interacting simultaneously with three or four different people and doing it with only one eye poor thing well see you again on sunday yes and thanks for being with us it was a pleasure talking to you bye rachelle likewise have a rest and good night to both bye [Music] [Music] you ,2
40,yMUZqxz-vYE,hello and welcome to another stephen mendy's video i feel a need to connect with all my dear subscribers i haven't had a personal message for a short while and i need to be getting back making some videos but we have some issues here right now that's uh stopping the production of videos hopefully the production of videos will increase once this semester is finished so stick tight dear friends stick tight to the channel and hopefully you will be rewarded shortly with your desired video if you don't get a video from me within a while you can feel free to remind me as i am so stressed out with all the maths and technical stuff i have to deal with with my students first on the agenda this morning is of volcanoes dear friends do you know what it's like to be downwind of a volcano we and barbados here were pelted with ash about a week ago and uh the ash was raining thick i had to we everybody had to cover their house cover up themselves going shut all the windows and doors i put a big box over my ac i couldn't turn it on and uh when we went out the next day there was ash all over everything but thankfully it wasn't as thick as we had feared and uh since then in spite of continued eruptions of lasso freyancin vincent we have been spared most of what we had been led to expect we might receive we have in actual fact only uh the dust on the ground to contend with right now as the only thing that's falling is a very light um ash and uh basically it may not even be from the volcano because we've been accustomed to getting sahara dust and a number of other things that fall upon the island as a result of winds every single year so things are pretty much back to normal as far as the falling is concerned but of course there's dust everywhere in all the streets it's like living in a sahara or something every time a car goes down the road clouds of dust erupt and i've been having to hose down the condenser on my ac at least much more frequently than i had before but we're back to the air conditioner running in our studio and we're here protected from the dust that thankfully because we were always sealed even in the good times so dear friends production can continue on the videos so that's just an explanation of what we've been through in barbados over the last week now dear friends i want to comment on another a couple of other issues today it has been a big um media uh blitz about ufos and aliens being cited and increasing numberly being admitted to by authorities which is giving rise to a whole new wash of ufo and alien information exciting confusing humans on the planet dear friends i want to i want you to know this morning that aliens that these people are manifesting do not come from some advanced civilization with either a good motive or a benevolent motive or even an hostile motive to the planet these aliens are just demons which have been around since the dawn of time but they're now packaging their mischievous behavior as uh in the guise of space-faring travelers so that humans may be tantalized by their deceptions how can i be so sure dear friends i give you the test if you see a ufo or you see an alien coming to talk to you do not entertain them do not give them the time of day rebuke them in the name of jesus christ and watch how fast they disappear dear friends in interrogating demons um entertaining demons socializing with demons swallowing the lies of demons is only going to cause you great distress in your life read if you wish to the lives life stories and experiences of those who have been involved with aliens read the uh what happens afterwards after they've been abducted to the ufos and all these so-called experiments have been performed on them and it's so interesting that most of this happens while they're in their bed at night supposed to be sleeping but dear friends if uh these people who have been abducted or involved themselves with aliens they always end up in a bad state nothing good is going to happen to them because you do not entertain or invite demons into your life you do not listen to them you do not believe them you send them packing in the name of jesus christ dear friends if you think i'm a crackpot uh why don't you put it to the test and ask yourself why would a space-faring benevolent traveler from another galaxy turn tail and run at the name of jesus christ surely he doesn't know anything about jesus christ i'm trying to tell you dear friends the fact that all these sightings these uh beings these abductions are immediately stopped at the name of jesus christ and calling upon the name of jesus christ is proof guaranteed proof that these are demonic entities coming to do you harm and the name of jesus christ and the faith sends them packing in the name of jesus christ okay next topic dear friends and we have to keep this brief this morning next topic is global warming and the current world economic forum agenda dear friends do you know what these people are planning these people are planning the new world order and a total enslavement of the population within certain parameters to uh control the world dear friends the only people who are going to own stuff and be able to do as they like are the filthy rich maybe two or three thousand filthy rich people will get to play and everybody else will be controlled the population must be controlled and this total enslavement will be worse than anything that has befallen humanity in terms of slavery on a global scale and it will be enforced if needed and your ability to dissent your ability to be a critical thinker is going to be challenged dear friends why would you believe the media why would you believe the governments of the world and what is even worse why would you believe any world organization such as the world economic forum the world health organization or any of these other global entities dear friend we are being played like a fiddle dear friend the facts speak for themselves and when a thinking person researches the facts for themselves they can see through the sham and this is not a global conspiracy theory i'm not into it i invite you to do your own research i invite you to think and analyze what you are being told dear friends i'll tell you one other thing before i go children are being parked in front of youtube all day long and they are sucking up information that is being piped into their heads without being taught any moral values or any critical thinking skills that they can even begin to evaluate some of the information that they are receiving since education is now a passer experience thanks to the coronavirus pandemic which is being fueled by fair because the cdc just released information on the global statistics of death and if you go and analyze that carefully and take your time to sift through the data the lie will become apparent but they are banking on the fact that even though these facts that they're putting out contradict what is being done and said nobody's going to do anything about it they are going to suck it all up and they're going to be cowed by the media and they're going to uh endorse the pla the plan and go with the flow and fit in with the neighbor next door dear friend you have a choice to make and you're going to get um you're going to sooner you make it the better stand up and deal with it or else become one of the fatalities in the future dear friends you need to think for yourself you need to critically assess in the light of the brain that you have been given the information that you are being fed and you have to say is this real does it make sense let us check on the facts and when you do your research you will see how you are being played by the people who are planning to reshape the future of this planet to suit their own agenda well dear friends i hope you have enjoyed the broadcast if you wish me to deal with any more of these topics at length please

41,lbgOs3HngMA,hate their own people the governments see there and this is true almost everywhere but there are some exceptions like poland for example the government of poland doesn't hate the people of poland the government of poland is fighting for the polish people in many many ways even against censorship for example the same way that trump was fighting for the people while he was at the white house but most governments of the world hate their own citizens their own populations most governments of the world are deploying acts of psychological terrorism and in some cases kinetic terrorism against their own citizens in the united states tulsi gabbard just warned about this speaking about the announcements of john brennan former cia director a total spooky spook as well as adam schiff who's a crazy crazy psycho you know sociopath who ran the what was it the house intelligence committee i think under the democrats and some other key people as tulsi gabbard says these people are enemies of the state or enemies of america i forgot exactly the terms she used enemies of the people maybe they are those people represent the heightening of the security state or the police state against the american people and what they want to roll out is a national system of spying on people running false flag operations to continue to justify their own secret police operations and vilifying their political opponents this is what it's all about and this is why they need more power they're desperately calling for more power and people like aoc are playing into this saying oh we're terrified we thought we were going to die why do why do republicans carry guns you know they were trying to shoot us and nancy pelosi i think gave a speech on the house floor that she said the enemy is within the enemy she said are the republicans here on the floor of the house she she actually said that because they're trying to use the government as a weapon against the people and this is happening at some level world wide in in other words we have reached the point where the government that is apparently in power at the moment and again hopefully the military will change that sometime coming up soon we will see but the government that's in power right now sees the people as the enemy and believes that its own priority should be to go to war domestically against the voters so the the biden regime knows that more people voted for trump than voted for biden vastly more millions more maybe tens of millions more so they're actually going to war the biden regime is going to war with the majority of american voters and they are declaring that anyone who doesn't believe that biden won the election legitimately is a possible terrorist so these are tactics right out of the old soviet union kgb tactics or stasi style tactics these are horrific tactics but they are being used globally by governments that hate the majority of their own voters now the the reason this is all important understand is because the globalists are losing the war they may be winning individual battles like they they are able to install their puppets into office in various countries around the world they are able to de-platform parlor for example they're able to de-platform voices and demonetize voices that they don't like they're able to attack and smear people right now lynn wood is under extreme attack i'll cover that in a little bit here those are battles that they may be winning but the big war the globalists are losing they're losing the war the the information war that they have been trying to wage against the people think about it in the last year how many more people have awakened to the truth about censorship or the truth that the media are lying to them there are more people awake at this moment than at any point in the history of all of our lives all of you listening to this and my life as well nobody has ever lived in a time when more people were awakened or red pilled you might say than right at this very moment and this terrifies the globalists they are terrified that if they can't get this clamped down if they can't brainwash people and indoctrinate everybody and eliminate the voices of descent then they are going to lose control and their globalist agenda of depopulation and genocide will fail this is their great fear and this is why they are resorting to extraordinary weapons of terrorism including psychological terrorism oh you're all going to die there's a new strain or now you have to wear four masks i mean where does that end we're gonna have like ten masks in the future it's just just completely insane but they're gonna they're gonna terrorize you psychologically and then they're going to terrorize you kinetically so here's here's a prediction i have you know there was an explosion in spain a few days back there are going to be many more explosions carried out by the deep state in countries that are reluctant to obey the demands of the globalists in other words poland will be one the uk the uk will be punished for brexit poland will be punished for not accepting globalism texas the state that is fighting against the corruption and the criminality of the biden regime texas will be targeted for deep state false flag operations and probably other conservative states because of course the biden regime are already working overtime to figure out how to carry out a false flag shooting that can be blamed on conservatives from red states and this is what they're going to use as you know then to ramp up even more secret police stasi activities kgb activities in the united states to clamp down on their political opponents deep state operators who work for the globalists have also as we've discussed before they have planted dirty bombs in cities around the united states and they may have planted nukes in certain cities as well and when they believe it is necessary there's no doubt in my mind that they will detonate those bombs and i believe to this day i still believe that the american well the u.s military one of the reasons why they did not move on biden and the treasonous criminals before inauguration day is because all of those dirty bombs have not yet been located so the dirty bomb threat hangs over the trump administration hangs over the military and it remains a constant threat it's kind of like i don't know two two criminals in a cell and one of them has a hand grenade and the pin has been pulled and he says uh you know if you attack me i'm going to let go this hand grenade and we'll both will both die you know that's what the deep state has done they've planted bombs in american cities and they've said if you don't do what we say we're going to set these off and you know radiologically contaminate a major portion of the united states of america that's how insane they are and that's how desperate they are so understand that what the globalists want long-term is depopulation but in order to get the deep population they have to have absolute control over medicine science information which means they have to have a censorship regime they have to control the money so that people have very few options people are shoved or funneled into poverty for example they have to control the news and the information and all the narratives so twitter has a new crowd source fact checking feature now which is insane i think it's called bird watch and this is how they're going to enable the left wing mob to censor any voice of dissent which is another reason to get off of twitter but all of these efforts depend you know the the efforts to corral people into global depopulation it all depends on getting people to go along with the program and that is where they are failing because the awakening is accelerating people want to be free people want to express their own unique ideas and individuality which is something that the radical left despises even though they say they support you know all the rainbow colors of different kinds of people no what the left actually supports is gay people and trans people and lesbian people and people of color who all think exactly the same you have to be obedient but you can you can have a variety of sexual proclivities or what have you but you have to think exactly the same the left hates diversity because diversity of thought is a threat to the governments of the world that have become the terrorist organizations you could even say you know how mike pompeo for example might well actually did say that china was carrying out crimes against humanity was carrying out genocide or that the trump administration would say that iran is a nation-state actor engaged in terrorism so it is a terror state well now under the biden regime the same can be said of the united states the united states of america under biden is a terrorism actor a nation-state terror originator that is using terrorism against the american people in order to achieve absolute control and dominance as a waypoint to its ultimate goal of mass genocide and the deletion of human civilization so it's critical to understand all of these waypoints and the process by which the globalists believe they can eliminate humankind from the earth they can't do it by force alone they need your consent in order to get your consent they have to trick you with psychological operations fake news gas lighting and the whole deal so as part of that now one of the key goals of the biden regime is to incite an armed insurrection by conservatives so that the biden regime can invoke the insurrection act and strengthen its police state surveillance of the american people and justify its own existence why is this critical for the biden regime to carry out number one democrats are really bad at running things if you were to gauge the democrats and joe biden on for example economic policies or economic outcomes they would earn an f just look at democrat-run cities and states how many of those cities and states are even financially viable in any kind of sustainable way the answer is pretty much zero pretty much zero so what what democrats have long come to realize is they can't rule in a rational way based on the merits of their policies the people will eventually discover that democrat policies suck and democrat ideas don't work so instead the way democrats have figured out how to rule is to create a crisis and to always have another crisis ready to go for example covet biological weapons it was a crisis and then they exacerbated the crisis in places like new york by you know putting grandma in with other infected patients in the nursing homes and having mass deaths you know they exacerbate the crisis but they never solve the crisis they always need a crisis to justify their own power because they have there are no merits that would cause a voter to ever reelect a democrat if it was just a merit-based discussion so what the biden regime is planning on doing right now is trying to push out maximum oppression of conservative people in order to to incite conservatives to try to carry out an armed insurrection and then biden would at that point invoke the insurrection act that trump failed to invoke and he would use the insurrection act to deploy the military all across america to monitor conservatives and have military checkpoints on the roads confiscate guns that's a very important step that the democrats are trying to achieve and then also to prove to the nation that democrats need to stay in power because they are the only ones who can effectively fight against the evil white nationalist insurrectionist movement that is a terrorist group that's trying to destroy this country see that's their narrative and because they can't achieve that narrative organically because there really aren't a bunch of armed angry crazy white nationalist insurrectionist trump supporters who are trying to overthrow anything i.e they didn't even show up on inauguration day i mean if they even existed wouldn't they have been there but no they didn't show up the whole narrative is a total exaggeration of reality there's not actually a an armed white nationalist you know uh militia insurrection attempt against the country so instead they have to create the illusion that there is one they have to create the illusion and so that is exactly what they are doing and that's what we mentioned yesterday the department of homeland security put out an alert and said that well the national terrorism advisory system that said hey watch out we have a quote heightened threat environment across the united states that's likely to persist over the coming weeks and that there are ideologically motivated violent extremists with objections to the presidential transition and i mean these terms are just amazing ,3
42,zFRkQu4we7I,since 2016 with their first public appearances as political winners it was noticeable that melania trump wasn't at ease with her position as a first lady it was always quite obvious when the couple melania and donald trump were together that something was very balance is it because of don sucks performance or because she knows well enough the intentions of her now ex-husband oh yes [Music] x hello my name is nikolas obraziwski and i welcome you to the only place where you'll find significant revelations exclusive news and stories from around the world the traditional media won't show and tell you came here for the truth more than you imagine the real melania is not the white house anymore for some time now she has been a doomsday prepper since she left her place in politics oh what you now see in the news my friend on tv or whatever is not a real melania she was replaced with a double and this is so significant because it is like insider trading you know what i'm giving you today is privileged information so you too can prepare for what is coming because she knows otherwise she wouldn't be a doomsday prepper don't you agree no one really knows the exact location where she is prepping but rumors tend to converge to a place in the region of moravia in the czech republic why this location actually my educated opinion is that there is solid evidence for this you see melania was the second wife of the dawn the first wife being ivana which her hometown is in moravia she is now 70 years old can you imagine she being dumb just because she became an ugly old sack exchanged by a much younger and prettier woman that is melania ivana sure has a big heart because she has no resentments against melania despite she being 20 years older but has a desire for revenge against dawn her ex-husband so the rumor goes like this ivana helps melania to step outside the limelight of the public eyes she helps her hide in the moravian region and to arrange all the necessary logistics why would ivana help her we can ask ourselves oh and my guess is that it is just natural a woman that was tapped in her heart by dawn for her self-esteem to die to revenge herself against an ass of a [ __ ] grappler also there is an advantage in the geography of moravia by being an inland country it won't suffer from the rising sea levels caused by a looming cataclysmic event of course donald trump knows that the woman he's with right now is not a real melania trump it was a mutual agreement and he didn't mind at all come on do you think the legendary dawn would mind grabbing a different [ __ ] while maintaining the happy couple scene for the world to see oh no divorce here everything is just great in america the melania look alike had to go through a process of selection and casting she apparently did well in the ratings and she accepted gladly the new job of course for the money the problem is that psychologically she might not be up to the task to be the first lady i mean being in bath with donald trump must be i know agonizing and on top of that there was an incident recently with a statue of melania trump that was set on fire in her hometown a very sad incident very very sad and must have been frightening for the doppelganger my wish is the real melania to contact her double and save her take her into her bunker in the moravia secret place because having a double is always useful a valuable asset indeed for when the crap hits the fan for when the world is in shackles and will fight each other for a place to shoot and also oh a three-way lesbian at the end of times so what do you think will happen with melania and ivana trump is ivana gonna revenge her self-esteem before she dies of old age will they be able to save themselves when the doomsday finally arrives could they actually save the world from their common ex-husband or will they form a happy family with an adopted child comment down below the different scenarios that could play out that's all for now hope you got something of this video if you do leave a thumbs up so you help me help humanity expose the true truth subscribe and watch the other conspiracy videos especially the prologue my name is nicole z and i make believe ,2
43,U2rsIqqSOfQ,[Music] what happened next in june 77 the fbi told me my life was in grave danger they had wiretapped a meeting at a mafia social club in brooklyn bill ayers and some black panthers and a gambino monster named paul castellano was there they all agreed i must be a federal agent and they put out a contract on me the weatherman the panthers and the mafia a triple threat [Music] what did you do well i i was very nervous it would be easy for anyone to shoot me on stage [Music] bullets would not bounce off me like they did captain marvel jr [Music] so i called president carter and i asked him for secret service protection but he said it was something only the president can have so i told him i was running for president he laughed but said he would recommend me for the witness protection program i realized if i was alive that lisa marie and daddy would be in danger and mama had died so young and i lost my twin brother i had to find a way to live for them that's when i remembered master comics number 110 captain marvel jr and a hidden death i must have read it 100 times it was where captain marvel jr faked his own death to deceive his enemies then he defeated them and came back as a hero that was my way out what about giving up your music career he was at a dead end and i i couldn't make any money selling records because in 73 the colonel has sold my royalties to rca to cover gambling deaths by early 77 the colonel was into the las vegas hilton for 20 million the fbi tipped me off that he has sold half my contract to paul castellano to pay it off i wasn't working for an italian crime syndicate since i got back from the army my career was kind of a living death anyway and all those bad movies and now i was just an image in people's minds so why not just kill the image and come back later as my own damn self i i can work undercover to defeat my enemies like captain marvel jr had done then after a year or two i could return as an american hero and restart my music career just like when i came back from germany it would be fantastic what did the others think about the fake death idea colonel parker dr nick [Music] the colonel said it was a great move public relations wise that it'd be a great way to make money off the fans you see the colonel couldn't control me anymore in life i was sick of him i was more valuable to him dead dr nick said it would help me get off the prescriptions i had come to realize that just because i was getting it from a doctor didn't mean it was good for me today entertainers submitted and they go to drug rehab and the fans don't mind but you couldn't do it at that time how did you put the plan together to fake your death we came up with a fantastic design just like captain marvel jr had done dr nick had a terminal patient with no family who was a big fan and he looked a lot like me my height my age so dr nick suggested that we let him come to the pool house at graceland to live then when he expired we could swap his body for mine dr nick gave him some cosmetic surgery got him looking even more like me what was his name roscoe holloway he was from germantown tennessee the only problem was roscoe was heavier than me he went about 250 and i was only 170. so i ate a lot of ice cream and fried foods especially late at night so we would match up when it came time but how could you possibly pick a date for a roscoe to pass away august 15 was our target date because i had to testify for a grand jury against frederick crowe he ran air cargo airlines out of florida it was a mafia front company for stealing aircraft i sold him one of my airplanes in the state dr nick was sure roscoe would expire in time and then he'd keep him on life support so we planned the body swap and everyone's job on august 15th i put on my dea staff suit i testified for the grand jury then i went home and went to my dentist around 11 pm since i wouldn't be able to see him for a long time then then i got everyone out of the house my cousin billy and my girlfriend ginger she looked just like mama when she was young i i called her little gladys we went to play wreck ball at what time it was around 2 am once we left my house dr nick went to the pool house and took roscoe off life support then he and joe dressed roscoe in my blue pajamas and put his body in my bathroom closet ginger and i went back to the house around 6 a.m i went to bed after a while i i told her i was going to read in the bathroom then then i took a sedative dr nick had given me and i went to sleep on the bathroom floor at about two in the afternoon ginger woke up came into the bathroom and saw me lying there [Music] i heard her holler to jail that i had fainted so joe came running upstairs and put on a pretty good show and called 9-1-1 then dr nick came running in when the ambulance arrived i i slowed my breathing for the mix i remember that in martial arts dr nick ordered them to put an oxygen mask on me and fetch a stretcher that's when we did the body squat i got into the closet dr nick put the oxygen mask on roscoe and set him on the floor then the medics came back and put roscoe on the stretcher dr nick went along in the ambulance so he could identify the body at the hospital as pelvis president presley tonight august 16th good evening elvis presley died today he was 42 his doctor pronounced him dead at three o'clock this afternoon what did you do next what was the plan for you first thing was i had to bust out of the bathroom closet because they locked the door on me then i went out the bathroom window onto the rooftop [Music] the plan was for a dea helicopter to pick me up now i was going to fly to argentina until things were over then all the cattle was in michigan but the helicopters saw a television crew outside the gate and left so i shimmed down the side of the house and walked into the schoolhouse it is a scene in memphis thousands of people middling around outside the mansion where elvis presley's body lives was it part of the plan to have a public viewing of the body the day after no no it wasn't as soon as my so-called death was announced colonel parker got a call from paul castello who screamed at him this is [ __ ] the colonel got scared and insisted on an open casket to prove i had died there are no cameras allowed but the national enquirer paid my cousin bobby mann to sneak one in now at the public viewing it was said you didn't look real that's right the problem was as roscoe got sicker than being on life support he lost weight while i had gained weight so by now we didn't look much alike but daddy remembered that madame tussaud's wax museum in london had sculpted my head for a wax dummy and sent it for approval [Music] still had to wax head in his office back in the house [Music] so we glued on some sideburns and hair i thought the hairline was too homework dude's a body his novel looked kind of powdery looking and his hair piece uh something glued on something like just didn't look right i just didn't believe it was him another problem was madame tussaud have made a 25 year old elvis head so it looked too young but in show business you work with what you have then for the body we took a wax mannequin from out of my closet where i kept my costumes and the wax head and body caused another problem it was so hot in memphis in august we had to put an air conditioner in the coffin to keep the wax from melting afternoon temperatures rose into the 90s the scheduled viewing of presley's body was delayed an hour people began fainting so at the funeral they wear a giant candle and an air conditioner it took nine guys to carry it it looked a little suspicious were there any other major mistakes well jill was supposed to say i was found in the bathroom but but he mixed it up with an earlier story we discussed that i was found in bed well i was upstairs and he wasn't breathing [Music] another problem was dr nick had me fill out my death certificate in june he was supposed to type it up but his secretary filed the original that was in my handwriting what about the spelling of your middle name on the gravestone why the extra a a-a-r-o-n instead of just a-r-o-n as on your birth certificate that wasn't a mistake it was intentional who wants to see their name on their grave i had no intention of putting a hex on myself why didn't they drink your casket in an american flag as an ex-army officer that would have been disrespectful to the flag and others who gave their lives for our country anything else to add about making your day well i i i feel badly to this day because you know i know roster was dying but i suspect dr nick may have finished him off to keep the schedule ,2
44,HQirrIiZxF0,they were taking children out of boys town orphanages and foster homes and driving them to soos the eye 184 miles away placing them in private jets flying into washington dc for sex orgies with congress and senators and dignitaries and i've covered that in my intelligence report by the way so um what does that mean well a guy named rusty nelson was taking pictures of them while they were doing this sort of thing and rusty would take a picture of him for them because they kept track of the film and then he would sneak his own film in because he figured he'd need insurance down the road and he was right and so he had these pictures of these dignitaries who were involved in these nefarious sexual activities congressman senators as i said now uh rusty uh was asked to participate in a sexual act with a man and he didn't he wasn't even part of that so he went out a bathroom window in a motel and made his way back to norfolk nebraska and his granddad had an old farm there that it was abandoned and he stayed on the farm for a while and the fbi came around to rusty parents and the mother very naively said oh rusty's over setting such a farmhouse the fbi went over and interviewed rusty at the farmhouse and rusty says it's time to take off and he took off of course now before this happened during the investigation gary carradoria gary carradora was a investigator for the senate committee schmidt and decamp and he made contact with rusty rusty was in arizona and russia said meet me in chicago he didn't want to meet uh gary carradore in phoenix and so he met him in chicago gary did and rusty turned over the pictures of him having sex with some of these dignitaries in washington dc senators congressman seward white house people okay use your own imagination and gary carradore made the mistake of calling lauren schmidt i have the smoking gun he had his own airplane and that night after the all-star game he had his 11 year old 12 year old boy with him they got in gary's plane and over aurora illinois the pain exploded gary died pictures were all over the place first person at the scene was the sheriff's deputy sheriff he picked up the pictures of the fbi and came along grabbed the picture and said keep your mouth shut um he apparently didn't keep his mouth shut because a year later his wife was murdered by the way a farmer said that he saw an explosion and government said that uh the plane just fell apart okay the rear seat was never recovered the uh gary carradoy's briefcase was never recovered and the pictures who knows what the fbi did with them i did everything i could to get my hands on that airplane and i was going to have it examined by a forensic specialist because if there was a bomb on that plane a french success expert could tell you that there was a bomb they could classify the bomb i couldn't get the plane because it was being held in a military base now why would the military take a plane being flown by a civilian and take control of it cover-up no question about it but uh anyway that's of the number back there if i had to guess just from my research and my experience i'd say maybe 35 good people back there including ron paul 35 out of a whole bunch that senator that is senators and congressmen that's what i would guess i you know i have no way of knowing but i know that well look look how they've been voting look at them they voted to extend the patriot act to make parts of the patriot act uh permanent that that brings up a second question it's so big and it is it is has so many tentacles and so many and so many parts of the government in the military and corporations how did it get like this you have you've been thinking about this for a long time i've only known about this for the past couple of years i wonder if you could put it in perspective somehow well i've been involved in researching this for 30 years and uh piece by piece it's selling in certain in order you know person is this and this i was given a lecture in the late 90s 95 probably middle 90s in las vegas and after the lecture fella came up with to me and handed me his book pawns in the game and he said this is what it's all about i didn't know anything about pond in the game i knew very little about the illuminati pawn to the game is available through me by the way and i urge you to buy it that in the franklin cover-up book by john decamp and uh these are both the most dynamite powerful books that i've ever read and that's how i learned about the illuminati i mean i'd heard about it but i really knew about them after that i learned about the 25 gold to take over the world and it got so big and it goes so well organized that i can move i can go from los angeles tonight to nebraska and have surveillance on me and have somebody come into my house in nebraska or here in l.a i've had surveillances on me washington dc philadelphia ohio utah uh california oregon i mean they've got a network of people of an army it's army and what it is is primarily primarily military intelligence remember eisenhower warned us about military industrial complex remember he knew jack kennedy ,3
45,Sjmi21goWwc,showing you the power of cancel culture and the liberal disinformation machine which is powerful it is and denying that it exists is it's just a disinformation in and of itself liberals do have a coordinated disinformation a misinformation machine and they use big tech to do it here's a hilarious example this is an actual screenshot from my phone today of how uh hoxxopedia otherwise known as wikipedia wikipedia how they describe spygate this is an actual screenshot spygate parentheses conspiracy theory spygate is a conspiracy theory initiated by president trump in may of 2018 that the obama administration had placed a spy in his presidential campaign for political purposes don't worry joe don't worry it's a conspiracy theory this is all made up don't you worry at all stand easy as they used to tell us in the police academy on the muster deck at 90 degrees sitting in manhattan melting stand easy well kind of throws a little bit of a monkey wrench into the whole conspiracy theory thing we just had some uncovered documents yes i care whether you folks do or not i care about spike i know a lot of you do new documents now reveal a wide arranging operation to spy on the trump campaign headline john solomon just the news story will be in the show notes today please read it on geno.com newsletter huh wikipedia scamipedia told us that this is a conspiracy theory so a secret fbi informant is now revealing that they were spying on the trump campaign that can't be joe wikipedia clearly said this is a catholic theory this is strange so here we go we have an actual fbi informant here saying this so quote one secret once secret reports show the fbi effort to spy on the trump campaign i thought that was a conspiracy theory was a far wider than previously disclosed effort as agents directed an undercover informant to make secret recordings pressed for intelligence on numerous gop figures and sought to find quote it's a quote liberals that mean someone said this anyone in the trump campaign with ties to russia who would acquire dirt quote damaging to hillary clinton underlining that there for the liberals here have a tough time effects so they wanted anyone in the trump campaign an fbi informant otherwise known as a spy was directed to get quote anyone in the trump campaign that can't be folks hoxopedia told us that this is all a catholic that's really bizarre oh there are more gems than this just the news piece here's a couple other bullets from it immediately after the fbi opened the collusion probe they narrowly focused on the foreign lobbying of a single trump campaign aide named george papadopoulos agents pressed halper he was working for them stefan halper as a spy for information on more than a half dozen other figures including future a.g jeff sessions uh foreign policy adviser sam clovis campaign chairman paul manafort economic advisor peter navarro and future national security adviser mike flynn and campaign advisor carter page you know what's really crazy joe this is really just bizarre i mean call you crazy here but so the fbi is a spy stefan helper they're pushing to spy on people and this list of people they're pushing him to spy on they all have one thing in common joe think it through take a minute take a minute slow down slow down i know you know you didn't eat this morning brain functions on sugar you know not can't use stored fat or anything like that blood sugar's low processing speed is slow but they all have one thing and can we pop that up again do you all have who at manafort peter navarro mike flynn carter page jeff sessions sam clovis george papadopoulos what do they all have in common um are they all greek george papadopoulos i would assume is greek no no i don't think mike flynn is greek just checking i think he's irish i don't know i haven't asked him maybe scottish not sure so it's not that um is it that they're all english speakers maybe maybe that's it that's it they're all english speakers that's why they were targeted um actually the fbi informed said no they were all targeted because they had one thing in common um they worked for the trump campaign but don't worry don't worry joe come on stop speculating stop getting ahead of yourself here don't get ahead of the skis stop speculating wikipedia says it's all a conspiracy theory it's all a conspiracy theory stop your nonsense you're spinning everybody's wheels you're wasting my time part number two of this little gem poor joe while current fbi director chris wray has insisted the bureau did not engage in spying on the trump campaign oh don't worry chris ray said so halper's taskings include many of the tradecraft tactics of espionage including the creation of a fake cover story saying he wanted a job of the trump campaign secret recordings providing background on targets suggested questions to ask and even contact information for potential targets man that sounds awfully like spying to me yeah man but you know liberals joe they're in love with the euphemism game they're like no that's not spying it's uh what do you call it what what it's undocumented surveillance they're not illegal immigrants they're undocumented americans this is undocumented surveillance they love the euphemism game because it plays to idiots it plays to people who are liberals who play video games who didn't realize like liberals would come after their video games next you were you were played like a useful idiot just like you're being played by scamapedia this is all a conspiracy theory the spying really we have a spy admitting they spied and said they wanted to spy on anyone in the trump campaign using spy tactics a guy who was a spy paid like a spy to do spy stuff in spade and spy tradecraft but definitely not spying definitely not spying on the trump campaign cause scamapedia said so ,3
46,aYTmUjDJiq0,hey i got a message for the fbi when are you [ __ ] retards gonna start making the rest of your own people blowing up your own building from the inside huh when are you [ __ ] idiots at the fbi and the cia when are you [ __ ] morons gonna make arrests of your own people they're the ones that blew it up i have copy of the security cam footage of the back door with some of your agents loading up dominion voting machines a mainframe server and some other stuff into an unmarked van with the license plate z3x2791 it was a state plate couldn't catch the actual state on there but had the number there's another van too that was off in the distance they were running stuff on a dolly too exactly three hours before the bomb went off oh and by the way also got pictures of you having people leave an hour before the bomb goes off off the front door and you know what's funny they're saying that for an hour and a half almost two hours that rv was parked there they're full of [ __ ] the security camera shows the rv being moved 12 minutes before the explosion after the area was evacuated you forget you [ __ ] there were people that were living in that building i had the video footage of you guys running all up and down the streets trying to check the buildings someone left the camera recording out their window when the blast went off ha ha losers i got one of your own people moving that [ __ ] rv just before the blast went off nice try oh and remember when you play messages and you're using voice recordings that are playing over a pa system make sure they don't use voice to text and it gets recorded to their [ __ ] atm t business cloud you [ __ ] morons trash file two two five backslash three e x two dot system backslash ping five d r three nine seven point two two one that's right that's the garbage file that has all the video from the surveillance cameras inside the building where they're running around like a chicken with their head cut off loading computers and [ __ ] up trying to get the [ __ ] out of the building before i wake up louie ha ha [ __ ] you i've exposed you you [ __ ] [ __ ] and there's nothing you're gonna do about it all the other videos been sent to where it needs to go come and get me [ __ ] boys come and get me ,2
47,-9xP3b41Qik,for those of you that can see this video or hear this audio i just wanted to to make you aware of what's going on i feel if i disseminate this information i may actually get a night's sleep i'm showing my face and i will reveal my name for my own protection so if something were to happen to me you know it was not an accident my name is robert connors and i have served with the department of defense for over 20 years prior to that i served active duty campaigns in both iran and vietnam i have served my country with honor and distinction my record speaks for itself as an ex-dod operative it was my duty to protect the constitution and mitigate foreign and domestic threats in this country i joined the department to create a safer world for my children and now grandchildren unfortunately the last decade of my career i have seen and been a part of one of the biggest threats to this great nation and its citizens in march of 1994 i was brought in as director of communications for a project called operation sedgwick formed under president ronald wilson reagan in 1989 this program was the second stage in the project called m k ultra its focus and sole purpose was the control of the african-american population and urban youth through music yes you heard me correctly through music i have in my possession a series of video and audio recordings detailing the existence of this project my division was ordered to destroy all documentation and archive footage i in good conscience could not this is the information that the american public along with the families involved we're told bold faith lies about from the first degree murder of the sane parish crooks also known as tupac shakur to the evidence of influence of entities well beyond this federal government beyond this world will be revealed in these tapes to my friends still at the department please i repeat please join me for the bible says whoever knows the right thing to do is but fails to do it for him it is sin i can no longer live in sin so i am giving the department of defense until monday september 23rd to do the right thing and discloses information if they do not i will release these tapes to the media outlets and into public domain via youtube and to show i'm not bluffing i will release michael jackson's final phone call on the eve of his death mr jackson's phone was being tapped and he is speaking of a government conspiracy to murder him i know this video this channel will probably be deleted so i urge you please save download and re-upload everything that i release for freedom of information's sake god bless you thank you for listening and god bless you all what's your i organization know if i should tell you this but i don't know who may be listening there may be a group of people don't want to get rid of me they don't want me [Music] i don't know it's going to happen but i just feel in my soul only god knows they can cute they could stop me they could free [Music] [Music] who could do these [Music] i don't care to be okay [Music] where where were when you heard the uh the sad news i was actually my father called me i was at home and i had just hung up the phone with with my business partner and he had just told me about pharah and i said oh my geez i wonder who's next because it always happens in threes to see people controlled him they controlled him they did what they wanted and it was very difficult for him to say no no no you must have seen this happening was there anything that you could do or say to michael to change that situation it's very very difficult because in situations such as that one we've tried so many times to intervene and it's not always that easy because they keep everybody at bay they keep everyone away actually everyone how did they do that by controlling and i i know because i have been in a controlling and abusive relationship but by controlling him controlling his thoughts control what he does not letting any giving orders not letting anyone through the gates not letting anyone near security things of that nature and this way they have them and they can control whatever he does the phones no phones in the house [Music] you suspect foul play do you think michael do you think it's murder absolutely absolutely i said it in the beginning and i i believe it to this day you must remember michael told me repeatedly that they were gonna kill him that he was gonna die and who did it this is one of the bathrooms uh there are two bathrooms in this this is one of the bathrooms this is one of the bathrooms latoya are you going to be attending dr murray's court case absolutely what do you think about him uh delaying everything what kind of sentence should you receive latoya they murdered my brother and they know who they are it's not just dr murray i promise you that it's more people involved and they know exactly who they are and i'm gonna let you guys know exactly what's happening what's going on it's more than just dr murray that's involved in this will justice be served the doctor that you're looking at the doctor that you see there was the fall guy that's what he was he was the fall guy and so there are people in the background pulling strings absolutely you must remember michael told me repeatedly that they were going to kill him that he was going to die and he would say that and when i heard my mother scream he's dead immediately i said who did it i didn't say what for what of what happened who did it because he repeatedly said that for the past 20 years my wife evie and i have been the victims of criminal activities perpetrated by a small network of individuals who are out to destroy us personally professionally and financially this network of individuals is manipulating the banking system and the criminal justice system for the purposes of sabotaging our credit and our credibility up until a year ago evie and i had never had any run-in with the law whatsoever we are not criminals nor are we fugitives from justice nor are we crazy we are simply artists and filmmakers who are being racketeered on we believe there are to be a malignant tumor of star whackers in hollywood how many people do you know personally who have died suddenly and mysteriously in the past five years i have personally known eight actors all of whom all of whom i have worked with and was close to heath ledger chris penn david carradine among them i believe these actors were whacked and i believe that many others such as britney spears lindsay lohan and mel gibson are being played to get out their money in the meantime many a celebrity's image and marketability is being co-opted co-opted and destroyed google helps out by keeping the negative stories near the top of a celebrity's web page because it's the negativity that brings in the advertising revenue in my own case my ex attorney lloyd braun has joined this tribe of bottom feeders by creating his own celebrity gossip website what is wrong with that picture when your own attorney starts defaming you who do you turn to to defend you lloyd braun also claims to have come up with the idea of the sopranos so he's obviously familiar with the ways and means of organized crime unfortunately my brother dennis has made matters worse by buying a house from mr braun on property braun originally bought with money he embezzled for me i recently discovered much to my surprise that dennis is also on the deed to my santa barbara property this is also the work of mr braun further confounding the valid the validity of the transfer of my fully furnished property in 1992 to mr bruce berman i've earned approximately 40 million dollars throughout my career i have profit participation in some of my films i am being embezzled from by this monstrous ring of accountants estate planners and lawyers who are mercilessly slandering me and trying to kill my career and i believe murder me in order to gain control of my royalties i wish to return to only one thing work so does your client plan on attending the hearing next week in santa barbara my client is intending to comply with the law in both jurisdictions and we are going to spend the next couple of days strategizing how to best achieve that would that not compromise the refugee it may we we have a number of options available to us now some of which existed before he made a refugee claim and some which arose yesterday so we're going to take a look at the best options and it may be that we do abandon the refugee claim so in favor of citizenship application and sponsorship there are numerous options work permits permanent residence status there are all sorts of options this is what we need to discuss in liberty and do you do you understand how paranoid and delusional your client sounds i'm not you ,2
48,DPRJzNc876A,based on what they're showing us it seems very fake when we're being presented with things like the moon landing footage and you've only got to look at it with a critical eye to see that it's done on a set [Music] hi I'm Nathan Oakley and I'm a flat earther I run several YouTube channels I interview people about the subject and I've been doing it for about the last couple years in my last career I was traveling around the world as an international sales rep and as I traveled around the world what I observed on almost every flight was the same thing which was lots of people staring at the back of their head rests and observing the latest movie drinking booze falling asleep whereas I would actually be at the back of the plane looking at the emergency exit window which had the widest viewing angle and observing the flat plane below that being the case when I came across a map our land video on YouTube and he uttered the words flatter not in ridicule but in the same context as we are talking about today he immediately was a Eureka moment I mean I literally went and woke my wife up and told her that the earth was flat well NASA were developed for the sole purpose of lying to us their only purpose is to perpetuate the globe lie every single story that is told by NASA has the sub context that we live on a globe way they're faking things is with top-of-the-line absolutely cutting-edge studio techniques like we're used in the film gravity so they're using trapeze they're on high wires in order to fake us for as long as humanly possible well that's a good comparison because the blockbuster movies bolster the NASA fakery if you're watching guardians of the galaxy or Star Trek or Star Wars the basis of that is that you are on a spinning globe so the fact that Hollywood perpetuates this this meme this lie this spinning globe lie is the over-the-top suspension of disbelief whereas when NASA do it they play their cards much more closer to their chests they always keep it nice and simple so they're not going to having Star Wars type battles in space they're just going to have a zero-g meal it's much more downplayed the Illuminati um I don't know a great deal about the Illuminati it's something that I've come across since finding out the earth was splatter investigating Flat Earth it would seem that there are certainly families or bloodlines or secret societies that control certain aspects of our life however until 1972 we hadn't been up and checked so for to say that a secret society knew and was therefore prepared perpetuating a deception I would say no no I can't prove it I can only support it with evidence so to say do I need to prove it I would say no because the starting point is flat that's what you observe that's what I observe and that's what everyone deals with in their day-to-day lives prepared every insult Under the Sun and I think the reason we get these insults is because we are pre-programmed from birth to ridicule the idea of Flat Earth we're told that it's a notion of Philistines it's something that we have progressed beyond so I tend to not overreact to people who are insulting to me about the subject and try and ask them to either if they're very combative prove what they believe which is the globe or ask them to research Flat Earth well I've never been to the ends of the earth so it's a difficult one to give you an answer is the moon fake news no but does the moon have fake news surrounding it yes absolutely of all of the celestial bodies it's the one that would most indicate surface ferocity right word being spherical and therefore it's used by people like NASA to prop up the notion that we are live living on aids s fear also so it's used to perpetuate fake news do I get ridiculed now no doesn't seem to be the case a couple years on it's more like this people actually wanting to know more information about the subject to doing a be research themselves so I think it seems things have progressed I don't have an actual explanation for how the seasons work I don't know what the Sun is same technically goes for the moon I don't know what the moon is and further that I don't trust any of the maps that they give us absolutely it is fundamental to state of being is fundamental to our existence if we said they are right the perpetrators of the life you like are correct then we are absolutely and totally insignificant we are a speck of dust in a soup of nothing expanding into a massive infinite space of nothingness whereas the converse is that we are in an enclosed system therefore we're it ,3
49,OnOzOZ2KW4s,Flat Earth clues part 5 the status quo this is part of a series of clues that can help you get your head around both the design of the Flat Earth system we live in and who has been involved in the deception to hide it from you this clue covers the inevitable and sometimes frustrating question of why the authority would go to all the trouble of hiding the Flat Earth my hope here is to show you different angles and a progression of events all of which lead to a very changed world both physically and mentally to open we have to go way back to when the world was a much more simple place you had your five major religions including Buddhism Hinduism Judaism Islam and Christianity each of these groups had their own version of what is known in Genesis as the firmament or the flat circular world enclosed by a solid dome-like barrier from where the creator or creators looked on i'm not going to explore all the subtle differences between the groups suffice it to say that it's interesting that despite their differences that led to acts of horrible violence between them there was no real earth model debate so around 500 years ago the science community led by Copernicus who probably had a little help introduced what we now know as the heliocentric or globe model of the world which in turn changed the solar system galaxies and so on the religions seem that this globe model was gaining popularity feared a loss in the fan base so they all adapted their religion to include the globe model from their point of view it was a small change from a circular to a globe world and really in a few generations who would remember anyway the churches mosques temples wrapped up their Flat Earth model in a metaphoric soft cloth and put it in the drawer with a good silver for safekeeping remember this because we'll come back to it later and hundreds of years went by with science promoting all the aspects of the globe Mobe and the religions promoting their beliefs upon this globe the world kept spinning so to speak and everyone was happy then in the early part of the 1900s you get this pesky explorer named Richard Byrd he has family money all the right connections and secures basically unlimited funding and the government green light to probe every piece of unseen territory there is it was inevitable I guess a young man who has an unquenchable desire to see all that there is to see and then granting him the tools needed to accomplish this goal he pulls a Truman and gets lucky crossing the vast salt ocean avoiding the icebergs arriving at the frozen coastline and he keeps going he was never going to stop one day after crossing hundreds of miles of high-altitude ice and snow Admiral Byrd sees it a barrier and to him it's just a barrier not the barrier he is but a tiny speck in front of it it stretches out on both sides as far as he can see and straight up so far that he can't discover the beginning of the arc the great Explorer now has a new challenge finding the shape of this thing it's much like a blind man describing in the elephant until you feel out the whole thing what do you really know if you look at the AE or Flat Earth overhead map you see the problem to even determine the scope of the outer wall you have to circle it it would have taken months if not years you could use a series of ships going in opposite directions or planes but there are refueling stations that need be built and so on his task was challenging to say the least Admiral Byrd kept laying the groundwork of the great discovery until his eventual death in 1957 a year later the United States and Russia found the upper edge from there the math was easy and moreover you could actually see the real world then of course there is the decision or deception depending on how you looked at it the authority made the call to hide the actual shape of where we live then sealed off the outer edge from prying eyes and created the space program not only to reinforce the globe model but to control it there was really only one reason they cared about this and it takes a while to process so let's look at the immediate effects of actual disclosure on work our way up to the authorities biggest fear for this exercise will look at releasing the news today instead of say 1958 well 1958 would have been easier it's much more relevant and entertaining to explain it in modern terms we start with a press conference by let's say the United Nations who have discovered that the world is indeed enclosed in a giant hi-tech dome of unknown origin and age the public reacts with Wonder and awe trying to take in the sheer scope of this announcement Facebook crashes Twitter crashes entire mobile networks crash it's like hitting a beehive with a sledgehammer news organizations around the world send teams to the outer edge to confirm the finding and the general public is glued to their media devices that's the good news the excitement the revelation the positive shock then the bad news starts coming in waves some of which you might not expect the first is the immediate disbanding of NASA and all other world space programs for obvious reasons most governments will secretly pardon these groups and keep them immune from class-action lawsuits the lawsuits themselves coming from NASA investment groups claiming fraud regardless everyone at NASA despite their good intentions is out of a job overnight and this is where you would say good they deserve it about time they stop lying to everyone oh but it doesn't stop there because every contractor and subcontractor that are exclusively tied to NASA they have to shut down as well fine a few thousand jobs lost no big deal and the ripples continue to spread some bigger than others observatories all over the world close their doors and the reasoning is this if you've been looking at the ceiling for decades and couldn't tell it was a ceiling then what good are you every University in the world that has an astronomy or astrophysics program well they don't anymore Stephen Hawking his book writing days are over Carl Sagan no more Nova in syndication I guarantee it those professors are going to have to retool their skills and be prepared to answer one giant question how did you not see it ort their clues people start finger-pointing and it will continue for years and still my fellow flat-earthers will say well hell that doesn't sound too bad so some nerds around the world lose their jobs so what you don't get off that easy is what the finger-pointing at the now-defunct NASA will then turn to finger-pointing at the government who directed the whole thing this is where we run into some dangerous ground involving things like the Ark of the Covenant the Holy Grail and the Ring of Power and you say you lost me I was with you until you started bringing up religious artifacts from movies and you're supposed to be lost of the five major religions we mentioned earlier those being Buddhism Hinduism Judaism Islam and Christianity none have been able to produce a supernatural object over the last five thousand years and trust me it would be beneficial to do so the Ark of the Covenant would benefit Judaism the Holy Grail Christianity and the Ring of Power well that benefits someone else maybe I'll leave alone for now the point is that all religions are actively seeking their leverage against science you've heard of the division between church and state well here it is advantage Church the barrier becomes a giant religious symbol and since it is backed by the big five it also becomes Universal the big five then go into their drawer with a good silver and pull out this belief that was forgotten but not lost and say we knew it all along and science lied to us temporarily all religions unite against science who has been only moderately weakened by the removal of their astronomy and astrophysics divisions but the public won't care because they will listen to the group shouting the loudest and no one yells louder than the church they will scream with righteous fury the dome was built by our God your God and the people will turn to science and hear nothing but crickets and that's where the world changes because in times of great stress the public will want words and while religion has no shortage of them science simply is incapable of taking leaps of faith I'll take a glass half-full approach and say that anyone listening to this is probably an intelligent rational person one who can make informed decisions outside of the conventional doctrine but for every one of you there are hundreds if not thousands of mouth-breathing troglodytes who will not walk but run to the respective house of religion and say you were right about this what else can you teach me this is what fills the current Authority with pause the unknown response to that question with religion take the high road and work with what remains of science to discover the truth it's possible I suppose it's also possible that religion will combine this technologically advanced society with a revitalized and aggressive doctrine that then transforms daily life into something that makes the book 1984 seem like a Saturday morning cartoon show I'm hoping that mankind will prove me wrong but so far that isn't the case so do some of your own research and ask questions please feel free to email me at em sergeant 23 at Comcast net or three zero three four nine four six six three one ,3
50,T8-YdgU-CF4,"this is a Reader's Digest version contending many of the interesting parts of the Flat Earth theory for those who have already started saying things with new eyes it will be mostly a recap but there could be a few new angles you haven't looked at for the rest of you who are new to this first question is invariably is this a joke because it's a joke right and that's where we start because it's one of our two basic childhood facts one plus one equals two and the earth is a globe or taught this before almost everything else and that right there should give you a clue on how serious the secret is but for those who have forgotten their history here's the modified men in black version for the first four thousand years of our civilization we believed that the earth was a flattish disk surrounded by a solid dome barrier called the firmament all the five major religions had their own version of this and the churches enforced the belief then around 1514 a man named Copernicus created a new model of the world he stated that if the earth was spinning around eleven hundred miles an hour and circling the Sun at sixty thousand miles an hour the world was then round and while the math more or less worked there was a problem it was 1,500 and the technology to prove such a theory wasn't there the first balloon to carry people wasn't invented until 1760 sailboats were the only travel over water and the fastest thing on land was a horse but the new world view was promoted and took hold the religions adapted to handle the new reality and life moved on more importantly the globe model was quickly introduced into the education systems over the next 500 years the challenges to this model faded to the point where the globe was accepted as universally as physical laws such as gravity read that again if you didn't absorb it for 20 generations people believed that the earth was round because there was a globe in every classroom they in there was no proof hundreds of years went by and still civilization had no way of proving the theory planes were invented around 1900 but until 1957 nothing could go high enough to give a true perspective of where we lived and that's when everything got strange the United States and Russia both sent up rockets high enough to take decent pictures and what they saw scared them a great deal how do we know they were extremely concerned about the sky because the US and Russia immediately started firing nuclear weapons straight up and they kept firing for the next four years a few things to keep in mind here first this was now 1958 nuclear weapons were very expensive and hard to come by these also weren't those nominal yield 20-kiloton toys we used on Hiroshima this was high kiloton too low Megaton and we couldn't get them up fast enough and the strangeness continued in other places in 1959 only a year into the atmosphere bombardment ten nations including the United States made Antarctica off-limits to any colonization a treaty was put in place and to this day remains intact over 50 nations now have signed off on this treaty do you know any treaty that has lasted that long between all industrialized nations moreover do you know any piece of real estate in the world that is owned by no one you would think the very least one of the large oil companies would use their huge financial resources to explore this region and yet they don't even petition the idea the short version of the discovery is this by 1958 the military had discovered the very solid upper and outer edges of our world and had to create a way to put up do not enter signs without looking obvious it was tricky but if there is one thing I have learned about the Authority it's that nothing is left to chance most of the work had already been done for them so their job was primarily in the details the sky part of the dome was much higher than commercial air traffic it's the only thing they had to worry about there was a space program which is immediately militarized the outer border had the natural benefit of not only an extensive ocean but a scaling decrease in temperature and a steady increase in iceberg frequency to discourage ships all leading to a permanently frozen landmass that could not be used for any form of agriculture this ocean and ice layout had worked well for thousands of years because the technology of the current civilization didn't evolve quickly sailors avoided cold weather seas whenever possible and oxygen levels get low enough to harm people even on high mountains the brilliance of the design comes in the simple fact that human males are corrupted by power corruption so total in fact that they would rather hide the world itself rather than risk their power on it you could theorize the kings and Pope's were told of the world a long time ago maybe an ancient scroll or book perhaps an interdimensional being told the tale of what the world looked like but this was all but dismissed because even the most powerful leaders of the day couldn't reach the borders and if they couldn't what chance to the general public have it's one thing to be told of the giant impenetrable dome but it's a whole different animal when you finally stand right next to it then the tough decisions have to be made do we keep the secret and how far we willing to go to keep the status quo once they decided to keep the secret no expense was spared the rapid progression of rocketry science had to be addressed quickly and so the moon missions were created Matt from the NASA Channel was right in his thinking that you needed the moon mission event to stage a picture of the Earth from deep orbit and that couldn't be more true establishing NASA as the front-runner of space exploration also diverted people who would have otherwise created their own space companies for profit the best engineers technicians and pilots were recruited to the NASA space program once there they were compartmentalized on a need-to-know basis the astronauts know of the deception and are sworn to secrecy under the penalty of whatever motivates them private space programs are discouraged sabotage or absorbed into the NASA fold private sector spacecraft are just not going to be allowed for several reasons the most obvious is the collision with the dome itself the telemetry data from such a mission would show an impact failure at a certain altitude and if repeated would raise questions NASA just isn't prepared to answer there are three perpetual questions about our world that can't be eliminated but avoided at all costs these are the questions you should ask yourself and others if this protective layer is going to be lifted I'd like to preface this with a thank you to Max Malone a conspiracy Hardcore who has a knack for boiling down debates to a single paragraph whenever possible it was he who said after over 50 years and thousands of hours of space travel footage both by NASA and other countries there is no exterior shot where the astronaut completes the simple act of panning the camera 180 degrees let alone a full 360 degree sweep this has never happened on any moon mission exterior space station nothing ever statistics will tell you this would have already happened by accident years ago but it hasn't and it won't this is because of the rule they cannot break the same rule that applies to television set shows that never show the fourth wall why because there is no fourth wall number two when you search online for pictures of the Earth from space 95% of what you will see is a collection of artificial composite shots in 2000 when I did this search there was exactly one picture by NASA showing the bottom part of Africa and Antarctica now that picture is hidden within hundreds of simulated images there are HD cameras everywhere and no one is taking a shot of the earth because you can't get enough altitude to do it number three the commercial air travel routes for the southern hemisphere are wrong this is an easy thing you can check out in 60 seconds take a map reading of the distance between anywhere near Australia and anywhere in South America it's a straight shot across the South Pacific now find your favourite travel site and try to get there non-stop see what happens the routes start turning ridiculous I used to business travel for years and I've never seen anything like it it's the one thing in the general public world they can't hide the actual distance between these two places on a round world the flight is easy just a straight shot across an ocean but on a flat world it becomes the greatest distance between two points there are no shortcuts so they distract you with multiple connections and lay overs it's only blind luck that the United States was in the northern hemisphere otherwise the increased traffic would have raised eyebrows by now I know I know it's madness it's lunacy there are people who will tell you straight to your face that all the leaders of the world are lizards and yet these people laugh out loud when you say the words Flat Earth I was and still am a huge conspiracy guy I literally ran out of new tin hat topics to research and I still wouldn't look at this one without embarrassment but every time I glanced at it there was something unresolved and once I saw the near perfection of the whole plan I was hooked do your own homework ask the questions get past the possibility and see if you can move into an even bigger picture like who built the dome and why that's where it starts to get really interesting and things start opening up I know I said years ago that the greater good was something that should be preserved that JFK Pearl Harbor and 9/11 were inevitable I still believe it and I understand the decisions the globe illusion however has run its course over the last 500 years it's time to start again if that means we end up getting the attention of who or what created this place and force the reset of the world is that such a bad thing I put some links in the description that you might want to check out like the current map projections used by the USGS the United Nations logo the Flat Earth Society high-altitude nuclear tests the Antarctica treaty among others I'm not allowing ratings or comments on this video for several reasons one this topic seems to bring out the worst debates because of the initial denial that and I've seen dedicated trolls in the Flat Earth Society website who show up every day and say the same thing to new forum members it's a joke it's not serious nothing to see here kind of strange that there are full-time trolls on a site that has less than 500 members worldwide that being said feel free to contact me at em sergeant 23 at Comcast net or heck just call three oh three four nine four six six three one I know no one uses the actual phone anymore but I'll answer what I can ",3
51,gKvWWY03IAw,"Flat Earth Clues Part 2 - Byrd Wall This is part of a series of clues that can
help you get your head around both the design of the flat earth system we live in, and who
has been involved in the deception to hide it from you. This clue revolves around one of the most
remarkable men you may have never heard of, Richard E. Byrd and his relationship with
Antarctica, and the secretive missions he carried out there until his dying day. Some of you have followed the legend of Richard
Byrd through the hollow earth theory. We aren’t going to be covering any hollow earth in this
video, but instead focus on the man and his involvement with the South pole. The readers digest version of Richard Byrd
is as follows: Born in 1888, he became an American naval officer who specialized in
feats of exploration. He was a pioneering American aviator, medal of honor winner, polar
explorer, aircraft navigator, expedition leader in the worst environments in the world, and
the youngest Admiral in the history of the navy. In addition, his list of awards takes up several
pages in Wikipedia, including three ticker tape parades in his honor. In short, he was
Indiana Jones on steroids. Some people will say that Roy Chapman Andrews was the real
Indiana Jones, and you might be right, but Richard Byrd beat Indy six days a week and
twice on Sunday. I mention all his accolades to paint a picture
of credibility and trust. The governments of the US and the world trusted his judgment
and leadership, and they took advantage of every chance they had to put him in charge
of special missions. The first large scale mission was an expedition
to Antarctica in 1928. This was noteworthy because even though he had just flown over
the North pole in 1926, all expeditions from 1928 on were focused on the South. The expedition
lasted two years, and during it, at the age of 41, was promoted to Admiral. His second Antarctic expedition ran from 1933
to 1935, and his third from 1939 to 1940. While in Antarctica he also was an advisor
for other countries who had their own expeditions, including England, France, Germany, and building
off previous countries expeditions from Belgium, Japan and Sweden. He then helped lead US Navy fleet operations
in World War 2, was present during the Japanese surrender in 1945, but then something strange
happened. He went back to Antarctica. Now some of you
aren’t surprised, because he’d been there since 1928, and I agree with you, it’s the
how that’s interesting here. His fourth trip to Antarctica wasn’t an
expedition, it was a military operation called operation “High jump”. Commanding an entire
aircraft carrier group that included 13 support ships, Admiral Byrd led 4700 men to the South
Pole, for reasons that are still shrouded to this day. Some say they were chasing the remaining Nazi
fleet, even though Germany had surrendered a full year earlier. Others say that there
was a Nazi base established in Antarctica during the war, when Admiral Byrd was absent.
None of these theories are important for this video. What we do know is that the US had sent an
excessively large military force to the ice, all under the guise of peaceful intentions. During this operation, Admiral Byrd told a
Chile newspaper this: The most important result of his observations
and discoveries is the potential effect that they have in relation to the security of the
United States. The fantastic speed with which the world is shrinking – recalled the admiral
– is one of the most important lessons learned during his recent Antarctic exploration. I
have to warn my compatriots that the time has ended when we were able to take refuge
in our isolation and rely on the certainty that the distances, the oceans, and the poles
were a guarantee of safety. After the operation, Admiral Byrd toured the
states, and gave interviews. The most interesting of which as a national television show in
1954 called the Longines Chronoscope, a horrible name, but a decent show. I’ve added a segment
of it at the end of this video and linked it in the description. During this television interview, he first
spoke of an area beyond the South pole as large as the United States, which no one had
set foot on yet. He then went on to say that there would probably be expeditions year after
year because the US government had really become interested. The interviewers then probed as to why the
interest in the South, when any perceived military threat from Russia (keep in mind
this was 1954) would be from the North. He went on to say that it was the most valuable
and important place in the world for science. It involved the future of the nation, an untouched
reservoir of untapped resources, including coal, oil, minerals, and uranium. He added that at the time of this interview,
there were seven nations currently engaged in Antarctica including Russia, Australia,
Argentina, Chile, and New Zealand. During the interview the Admiral talked about
planning the next military mission to Antarctica. It was called Operation Deep Freeze, and ran
from 1955 to 1956. The mission was completed, and he supposedly
returned home. Now this is where you come in and say, so
what, and normally I’d agree with you, except for what happened next. Nothing happened next.
The missions just suddenly stopped, and that was it. No other expeditions, military or
otherwise were conducted on the continent, ever. Then a treaty was put in place banning any
country from doing basically anything. The end. And if you’re wondering what your missing,
it’s this: Admiral Byrd goes on television, says that
this massive body of land, most of which sits on a plateau 2 miles high, is rich with every
resource you could ever want, ENERGY rich, pristine, with no indigenous population or
plant life, and every country that has sent teams is ready to carve it up like a big turkey,
not to mention there’s a expanse of land larger than the United States they haven’t
even LOOKED at yet, and out of the blue everyone just calls the whole thing off? There are
no environmentalists in 1959, this is the land of Diner food and 20 cent gas! I’m calling total BS on this one. The dollar
value of the initial resource find would have fueled armies of greedy companies. So what
happened? They found the edge that’s what, and the last thing they were going to do was
let unsupervised companies near it, regardless of the money. Even if hundreds of miles away,
you couldn’t allow resource corporations even into a safe area, and then years down
the road as they expanded, tell them, oh, sorry, you can’t go beyond this point. When
the companies ask why, what would they tell them? And now the interior of Antarctica is off
limits, with no revisions until the year 2041. You can take tours of the outer islands, but
there is a hidden line, enforced by the military, that you will not be able to cross. Because the interior is actually the exterior
edge. It’s there, it’s hidden, and it’s protected. The earth you live on is flat. So do some of your own research, and ask questions.
Please feel free to email me at msargent23@comcast.net or 303-494-6631. Our very distinguished guest for this evening, is Admiral 
Richard E Byrd.
The North Pole used to be a no mans land, but these are the days 
when, by buying a ticket on a commercial airliner, you can fly 
across the North Pole and drink a cocktail at the same time.
In only three score or more years ago, about 35 years ago, our 
guest tonight, found out whether there was any land North of the 
North American continent. He made that first discovery flight, 
and I must say that Admiral Byrd, our guest tonight, is not only 
our greatest living explorer, but he's been an inspiration to 
countless Americans.
Admiral Byrd, you've been to both the North pole and the South 
pole. Is there any unexplored land left on this earth that might 
appeal to adventurous young Americans?
Yes, there is. Not up around the North pole because it's getting 
crowded up there now because they're finding out it's really 
useable, not only to live in, but militarily.
But strangely enough, there's left in the world today, an area 
as big as the United States, that's never been seen by human 
beings, and that's beyond the pole on the other side of the 
South pole, from middle America.
And I think it's quite astonishing, that there should be an area 
as big as that, unexplored, so there's a lot of adventure left 
down at the bottom of the world.
Admiral, an expedition in which you are the advisor is now en 
route, what is that expedition doing?
Well, that's the icebreaker adtka, and it's a reconnaissance 
expedition that's going down to the South pole area to make 
certain observations, and look for some bases. They will be back 
in April, and report back, and upon the information we get from 
that undertaking, we will base the bigger expedition that is to 
follow.
Is that very definitely planned? That is being planned right 
now. So I'm willing to say to you that there will be a number of 
expeditions that will follow year after year at the bottom of 
the world, because the government has really become interested.
Well Admiral Byrd I can understand how everyone is interested in 
the North pole, because it's so near our greatest challenger, 
Soviet Russia. But why this interest in the bottom of the world, 
nobody lives down there, right?
No, it's pretty cold. There is only one permanent resident, and 
that's the emperor penguin, the little ones live further North. 
I'll tell you one reason they are interested, It's by far the 
most important and valuable place in the world for science. 
That's where the scientific groups from all over the world are 
interested.
But more important than that, it has to do with the future of 
the nation, and those to come after us, even during your 
lifetime, because it happens to be an untouched reservoir of 
natural resources, and as the world shrinks with ever increasing 
acceleration, far flung places which we used to think were 
useless, like the North pole, and no mans land, become very 
useful.
The bottom of the world, will be important, not only to us, but 
our allies. I was going to ask you, does it have military 
importance? It has some. Now as the world shrinks, it will 
continue to shrink with ever increasing acceleration, thus 
bringing these places closer, and in the future, and I can see a 
time when it will become very very important strategically. 
Has the development of air power increased the strategic 
importance of places like the South Pole? Very much so, very 
much so.
Even now, if something happened, and we lost the Panama canal, 
we would have to control the islands just North of Antarctica, 
which are a part, of Antarctica.
Admiral you speak of the resources of Antarctica, what are they, 
what are the natural resources there? Well, we've found enough 
coal within 180 miles of the South Pole, in a great ridge of 
mountains that’s not covered in snow, enough to supply to whole 
world for quite a while.
That's the coal, now there is evidence of many other minerals, 
we're pretty sure there is oil, that coal shows the bottom of 
the world, now by far the coldest spot where that coal is, gets 
to 100 below zero in the winter. It was once tropical. So we 
think there is oil there, and there is evidence, probably 
uranium. 
Is it any secret, is there uranium there, that would be the only 
thing practical to actually go after I suppose. Everything else 
would be economically unfeasible wouldn't it?
Well, as we recklessly expend our resources, the time will come, 
when we'll have to go after that stuff there. You know I avoided 
what you said about uranium, I'm not sure, I don't want to fight 
over the Antarctic. 
Is there a competition among other nations as to trying to get 
information about Antarctica and to possibly secure some of 
these resources?
Well, yes. There are now several nations very much interested. 
Russia is interested tremendously that I am sure. Australia has 
an expedition down there, the Argentines, Chile, New Zealand, 
Britain, and so on. Now you can understand those people being 
interested because they live down there, the New Zealanders, the 
Argentines, the Chileans, and the Australians, and so, we don't 
do much about claiming anything.
Admiral, you make it sound crowded. Are there that many 
expeditions down there or in route there? Well you know, as I 
said, it's the most peaceful place in the world, but I don't 
think it will be for long because of this intense interest on 
the part of other nations and this nation. ",3
52,7VpWYpAWxrM,"Flat Earth clues part 3 the mapmakers this is part of a series of clues that can help you get your head around both the design of the Flat Earth system we live in and who has been involved in the deception to hide it from you this clue looks into the USGS otherwise known as the map makers of the world and a few surprising things that they and others have in common with the Flat Earth idea all the reference links are provided in the description below and I encourage you to check them out for those of you outside the United States usgs stands for United States Geological Survey a scientific branch of the US government formed in 1879 and with the help of the ever-expanding American Empire they quickly became the premier map makers of the known world currently they have around 9,000 employees and an annual budget of over a billion dollars a year they also have extensive science departments covering biology geography geology hydrology and many programs tied to them their motto since the 1990s has been science for a changing world I'm going to show you how true that really is what does this large really boring government group have to do with the Flat Earth to understand that you have to look into their origins which is in geography to do this you'll need to open another page that specializes in maps the maps you see in this video are from Wikipedia but there are others you can reference as well the wiki list of map projections isn't much to look at as a whole although there are a number of interesting takes in the world view not only do they have just about every perspective when it comes to the land we live on but some detailed information on where the map originated including name type the origin or creator and the year the map perspective was proposed now some of these will be very familiar especially the ones that you would see on your classroom wall there are a number of variations here but the one that has been debated on recently would be this one the galls Peters which accurately shows the size difference between the continents the most obvious clue being that the white continent of Greenland is actually tiny compared to Africa but I digress if you keep going down through all the different shapes you'll get into circular maps but only one of these is a top-down perspective that shows the continents in the center surrounded by an unbroken Ring of ice in wiki it's called the azimuthal equidistant and just to make it easier I'm going to abbreviate and call it a e for short why is this map so interesting well if you're looking at the wiki page you'll spot a few reasons the first is that in the notes section of the map and I quote used by the USGS in the National atlas of the United States it also mentions that it is used as the emblem of the United Nations of all the maps on this screen it is the only one that references a group of any kind and if you keep this page open and navigate over to the Flat Earth section of wiki you'll notice towards the bottom of the page a similar map I've referenced it here and you can tell quite easily it's identical but not referenced or link as the AE model to make things even more strange we go back to the USGS model and you see that it was first proposed a thousand years ago and you may think well that's a bad link so you compare it with the person who proposed it and you get this guy al biruni who was al biruni while he lived around a thousand years ago it was considered one of the greatest scholars of his era schooled in multiple Sciences have you ever heard of him I hadn't maybe it's multiple bad references in wiki well no because NASA knows who he is and named this moon crater after him so why is the usgs using a version of the world map designed by a thousand year old persian scientist because it's correct that's why so to be clear let's compare them again the United Nations flag the USGS official map of the earth and the Flat Earth model all identical but one isn't recognized and instead ridiculed as an outdated look at the world and this is one of those political quandary x' that the authority gets stuck in the short version is this the government is on the same page as the Flat Earth but they can't admit it even in confidence we know the earth isn't flat they say but it really is we know you use the same map as we do but ours is just an image and anyone who says differently is obviously crazy it makes you wonder how long the usgs has been using that model as an official reference the United Nations started using it for their logos in 1945 and then made some final adjustments in 1947 and the UN flag also raises a few questions like why isn't Antarctica represented on the map is it supposed to be assumed in the outer circle or perhaps the spiky olive branches on the outside they don't mention it anywhere online and this is what I like to focus on the gaps the holes in the plot the unanswered questions the USGS using the same map as the Flat Earth but not saying why not recognizing it or that you can't link the very same image from the Flat Earth wiki back to the actual AE definition of the projection the authority figured out in the 1950s all the borders of our enclosed world and have done a great job hiding it over the decades but the world is a complex place and there are clues out there just lying around I think it's time you saw some of them so do some of your own research that ask questions please feel free to email me at em sergeant 23 at Comcast net or three oh three four nine four

53,GIho_gCvYP4,climate deniers people who believe climate change is not happening in any meaningful way are sometimes painted in the media as fringe characters as kooks so this might shock you a man who co-founded the weather channel thinks climate change is a hoax his name is john coleman before launching the weather channel in the early 1980s he was the original weatherman on good morning america and after launching the channel he was also a local weatherman in new york chicago and san diego now he's retired but his recent open letter saying that climate change is quote not valid got a lot of attention and landed him in prime time on fox news so what did the weather channel do it very publicly disavowed him after all for those who believe that the climate is changing and fast this is a life and death matter i've said before here on reliable sources that i don't think there are two equal sides to climate change the scientific consensus is that it's real the debate is over what to do about it and the press has to be careful about creating this notion of sides but coleman's platform as a co-founder of a channel dedicated to weather is unique and so is the channel's declaration that it believes climate change is happening so this morning both players are here coleman and the ceo of the weather channel david kenny first let me bring in john coleman he's in san diego this morning thank you for being here it's nice to be on cnn hello to all your viewers i resent you calling me a denier that is a word meant to put me down i'm a skeptic about climate change and i want to make it darn clear mr kenny's not a scientist i am he's the ceo of the weather channel now i was the founder of the weather channel not the co-founder and i'm glad you did because i am addicted to the weather channel now hold on just a minute i'm not done and cnn has taken a very strong position on global warming that is that it is a consensus well there is no consensus in science science isn't a vote science is about facts and if you get down to the hard cold facts uh there's no question about it climate change is not happening there is no significant man-made global warming now there hasn't been any in the past and there's no reason to expect any in the future there's a whole lot of baloney and yes it is has it has become a big political point of the democratic party and part of their platform and i regret it's become political instead of scientific but the science is on my side i don't think we're going to come to conclusions on cnn but i'm happy that i got on the air warming what i do wonders when you see the government when you see nasa when you see other institutions say that 97 of climate scientists agree do you think they're making it up but what i don't understand is how that's a manipulated figure and let me explain it to you uh this the government puts out about two and a half billion dollars directly for climate research every year it only gives that money to scientists who will produce scientific results that support the global warming hypothesis of the democrat party a position so they don't have any choice if you're going to get the money you got to support their position therefore 97 of the scientific reports published support global warming why because those are ones the government pays for and that's where the money is it's real simple but that doesn't mean it's right that doesn't make it true that only makes it bought and paid for the money goes in circles i'm not a scientist i'm not going to try to refute you well that's the truth from this from this issue and let the two sides be on the air there are 31 000 scientists who have signed a petition that says it is it is not valid that my position is correct and we'll keep battling and we we will prevail in time but i don't know if we'll do it in my lifetime i do hope viewers are googling the data you're sharing because i do think it's cute i have to say that i want to ask you about the weather no it's not true and i i hope you will go to the websites that present the papers that show that none of this alarmism about ice and heat waves and droughts none of it is happening is the weather channel part of the conspiracy well the weather channel has bought into it as i said they've drunk the kool-aid but so is all the media that's no big surprise let me read to you what the channel said this week because after you appeared on weather channel statements well let me read it to the viewers then after you appeared on fox they did put out this statement distancing themselves from you they said mr coleman does have a place in our company's history and we appreciate the contributions that he made more than 30 years ago however we want to be clear john coleman is no longer affiliated with our company how did you feel to see them disavow you in that way well no problem i mean you know that's all accurate and uh the statement that's on their website that which they re issued this week right was written back in 2007 and that's a rather reasonable warmest statement it's not full of alarmism it's not full of the sky is falling it's a pretty reasonable statement it's not the programming they put on the tv that's not reasonable and and you know when they put on their climate geeks those aren't scientists those are nuts you sound like a man disappointed but they never put on a real skeptical scientist uh they don't give us any spot on their channel that's too bad that they don't you sound like a man disappointed by the channel that you helped create oh i'm terribly disappointed i created a channel to give people their weather tell them what the weather is now and what it's going to be where they live and in their region and keep them one of the giants in the history of the philosophy of science karl popper once famously observed that a theory that explains everything explains nothing and to be sure the theory of catastrophic anthropogenic climate change appears to explain everything after all we all know that climate change makes for shorter winters except for when it makes for harsher winters and climate change means less snow except for when climate change means more snow and climate change causes droughts in california and floods in texas and oklahoma and generally makes wet places wetter and dry places drier except when it makes wet places drier and dry places wetter and climate change causes more hurricanes at the same time as it causes less hurricanes climate change causes more rain but less water and less rain but more water climate change decreases the spread of malaria at the same time as it increases the spread of malaria but don't worry the terminator himself advises us not to listen to those climate change cynics hey guys do i need to go on oh okay climate change makes san francisco foggier climate change makes san francisco less foggy climate change causes duller autumn leaves climate change causes more colorful autumn leaves climate change makes for less salty seas climate change makes for saltier seas climate change causes the polar ice caps to melt climate change causes the polar ice caps to freeze climate change makes the earth hotter unless the earth isn't getting hotter in which case climate change can explain that too what's the problem here this sounds like the perfect scientific theory it can explain literally everything including self-contradictory things this means it's absolutely perfect isn't it well no not according to karl popper and the philosophers of science and within the philosophy of science there's something called the demarcation problem how do you differentiate science from pseudoscience if you're at all interested in this i would suggest you read through karl popper's conjectures and refutations in which he lays out his criterion for differentiating science and pseudoscience namely falsification what on earth does he mean by this well he starts with a very simple but very profound observation that people are attracted to pseudoscientific theories by their apparent explanatory power these theories appear to be able to explain practically everything that happened within the fields to which they referred the study of any of them seemed to have the effect of an intellectual conversion or revelation open your eyes to a new truth hidden from those not yet initiated once your eyes were thus opened you saw confirmed instances everywhere the world was full of verifications of the theory whatever happened always confirmed it thus its truth appeared manifest and unbelievers or deniers if you will were clearly people who did not want to see the manifest truth who refused to see it and it occurred to him that although this is usually taken to be a good sign of a theory it began to dawn on me carl popper that this apparent strength was in fact the weakness of these pseudo-scientific explanations so he goes on to list his conclusions as to how we ultimately try to differentiate science from pseudoscience and i think a couple of the most important conclusions here are number four a theory which is not refutable by any conceivable event is non-scientific irrefutability is not a virtue of a theory as people often think but a vice and also number seven here some genuinely testable theories when found to be false are still upheld by their admirers for example by introducing ad hoc some auxiliary of some assumption or by reinterpreting the theory ad hoc in such a way that it's it escapes refutation such a procedure is always possible but it rescues the theory from refutation only at the price of destroying or at least lowering its scientific status and he sums it up by saying the criterion of the scientific status of a theory is its falsifiability or refutability or testability so i would say that the ball is in the court of the believers of the catastrophic anthropogenic climate change hypothesis by what means can one falsify this hypothesis let's start with just an even less of a hurdle to to come over what set of observations over what period of time would be enough to refute the theory and then furthermore are there any actual hypotheses any predictions that come as a result of this theory that can then be tested against the real world or real observations if the answer to that is no then well you've got a word for your theory and it's not science it's pseudoscience so again the onus is on the believers in the catastrophic anthropogenic climate change hypothesis to come up with some way that you can test and potentially falsify this theory because if you can't come up with any actual way to answer that that question of how you falsify the theory then you might as well just pray to your witch doctors to save you from the weather gods james corbett corbett what the left gets wrong about climate change are first of all very numerous examples but the first and most important one is this idea that all scientists agree that there's a 97 climate consensus that no one disagrees in the scientific community and this is perhaps the most outrageous uh falsehood of all if you go back 25 years al gore was promoting the same claim that all scientists agreed before we even had a climate debate and what happens is once you start looking at the 97 claims we find out that they're quite literally pulled from thin air in the words of one of the top united nations scientists dr richard tol or we find out that they're not even 97 scientists one of the surveys was only 77 scientists and they were anonymous scientists uh and this is how they create a myth it's a talking point designed so you don't have to think all scientists agree four out of five dentists recommend this toothpaste why wouldn't i buy that toothpaste why wouldn't i believe in climate change the other myth is that we're in the unprecedented hottest year hottest decade the earth is at a boiling point these hottest year claims are merely political statements that they're within the margin of error between hottest year statements and then the most outrageous myth of all is that carbon dioxide is somehow the control knob of the climate i point out in the book with ivy league geologists nobel prize winning scientists that we've had ice ages with higher co2 levels the co2 is not in any way shape or form controlling the climate that there are quite literally hundreds of factors from ocean cycles to tilts of the earth's axis the clouds water vapor volcanoes and sun solar cycles that they do not control co2 alone does not control the climate it is one of these factors that get essentially drowned out and you can't distinguish its effect from natural variability chains yesterday and now we're learning that scientists and researchers are looking at how to change the weather on purpose that's right lasers now could one day manipulate rain and lightning cbs this morning contributor michio kaku is a physics professor at city college of new york professor nice to see you extraordinary seeing al gore and bill clinton there together with charlie wasn't it that's right yeah they did not get into this discussion but it is fascinating i mean lasers really to change the weather that's right well as mark twain once famously said everyone complains about the weather but no one ever does anything about it well instead of doing a rain dance we physicists are firing trillion watt lasers into the sky to actually precipitate rain clouds and actually bring down lightning bolts this is potentially a game changer but this is experimental it's experimental however in the laboratory so far it works when you have water vapor and you have dust particles or ice crystals you can precipitate rain it condenses around the seeds these seeds can also be created by laser beams by firing trillion watt lasers you rip apart the electrons creating what are called ions and these ions act like seeds like dust particles bringing down rain and even lightening go ahead well i i this is fascinates me in part because too i remember reading the stories that china had used this during the olympics that the ussr had used this after chernobyl to create rain clouds i mean did those really work then we have some of these capabilities now inconclusive even in the 60s the cia used this to uh bring down monsoons during the vietnam war to wash out the viet cong governments have been playing alleged to alleged too right now we realized that for decades now these governments have been alleged to have experimented with weather control but nothing conclusive this time we're bringing in the laws of physics rather than simply waving our hands and hovering mumble jumbo we're actually using trillion watt lasers now and in the laboratory sure enough they precipitate rain out of water vapor sure enough you can actually bring down electricity down down the beam so what does it mean for drought areas that need to have rain for crops and if they don't have uh there's the consequences of famine well the bad news is if it's a clear blue sky it's not going to do anything at all because it only takes water vapor that's already in the air and condenses it however for floods for agriculture farmers for people planning waiting parties football games you name it outdoor events and agriculture and flooding and even hurricanes all of them could be subject to weather modification incredibly interesting professor michio kaku thank you so much [Music] you ,3
54,8absr185b04,[Music] there are forces out there that mankind cannot comprehend the earth is warming up radiation is building sickness is running rampant all over the earth but why see if something is just indigenous to earth maybe mankind can change it but what we're what we're having is not indigenous to earth it is not just for earth entire solar system is beginning to do a wicked shimmy and solar activity is a telltale sign of the exotic energy that's coming into the solar system what it emits the solar system is responding to just like your skin responds to infrared light so does the solar system respond to these exonic particles coming in because the source is coming close the source of these waves is coming close now close does not mean right there where you can see it i can assure you that prior to you seeing anything this world is gonna rumble like you never saw before [Music] welcome to the wtf files the ultimate aim of all science to penetrate the unknown the greatest mystery is right here right under our feet these are the stories that will make you say wtf for the risk of sounding like a person who truly did jump out of the bushes yelling it's coming it's coming [Music] very serious conversation we're going to talk about today it's not my job to cause anybody to believe but out of my heart i do wish to give you warning a little preparatory time that you be prepared not taken by what you mean what you may see coming it's as simple as that i'm to put some things into perspective it will either confirm the truth within you or not but in either case we're going to see drastic changes both in the earth and mankind we will see them your entire paradigm what you know is reality has been secured for a long time [Music] everything has stayed stationary in the skies we keep track of seasons and everything else by atomic time things of that nature of constants and science and formulas we've been spoiled really we've had a time of rest for a long time the only problems we've absolutely had were problems of war but the great calamities were held back far and few in between so then the knowledge that existed so long ago will be thrust in the faces of many in the days to come everybody has to be prepared for this according to the truth that you can take in today we're going to discuss preparations for the second wave what the second wave is things that have been happening on the earth indicating massive changes that are taking place i'm not here to connect the dots with anybody else's research but i'm only here to tell you exactly what i know of myself it does go over the darkness a deep darkness that's coming back upon the face of the earth i tell you this you guys for me with the book of revelation another text you know that's something will come up on the face of the earth from below and something will come up on the earth from above what comes from below is already here mingling among men but you don't know how many don't know the explanation of their own dreams many don't know the importance of the magnetosphere many of us have been spoiled because everything has been somewhat stable ladies and gentlemen that stability is about to be challenged in one of the worst ways it can and as these things begin to change and alter the earth so will the minds of mankind become desperate in war will naturally ensue i'm going to explain to you what the darkness is as best i can what i'm familiar with and it takes a toll on everybody who comes in contact with it in fact a person who's irresponsible should never seek out darkness it will truly consume your soul i'll tell you this exotic elements that are coming into the solar system so will that darkness grow darkness will again be upon the face of the earth and what was ancient will rise up again folks you live in a very different time most of what i'm going to say to a lot of people you won't believe but then again no one believes until something happens and then when something happens they seek out the source of those who knew by that time the sources have all their they're all but gone unless you're stuck in a place with no instruction with things you cannot possibly believe just like the undoing of the earth there are signs all around you interiors of the earth everything is waking up the earth right now is about to turn one degree and what indication do you have of that does anybody have an indication of that and it's not going to take a long time for the earth to shift one degree one degree in a tilt is huge one degree one degree is going to continue to change the weather in an abrupt way the water will move melting will start and this is what they always knew about it is under the cover of global warming i tell you this the changes of the earth have nothing to do with humanity and everything to do with truth and is covered over with a lie global warming a key word used for the elite to grab their attention and foretell meetings and everything else do you know what happened in 2004 that's when all the knowledge was solidified the knowledge of global warming actually began in the 1900s that's when the observations took place in 2004 everything was solidified preparations were made in the 1930s and 40s so they could survive yes they have underground basis who doubts that and this won't be a talk about the underground basis but i'm telling you they do exist they do exist i mean everybody should know the common underground bases cfr for greenbriar built in 1958 1962 that was build time it was to allow people to operate and sustain them for 60 days nora and shine mountain 1961 1965 build time that's the space control center communications with national military command iron mountain that's where the elite are protected we can go on china lake mount weather denver australia israel they have underground bases there too these things were built four to five year build time back then what do you think it is now how fast do you think these structures are now and i tell you they're preparing for something you know it is global warming which began 2004 do you not know in 2004 global warming was actually placed on netgeo's website national geographic and it was also on business week what's it doing in business week and they give you the cover that somebody was trying to make money off of it that was to throw you off the path let me tell you how they were can i just tell you how they work because global warming has to do with the exotic things that are coming into the solar system they are intertwined one in the same let me tell you how they work though because you not having certain knowledges you're kept in the dark about many things you can only believe what you see and so you buy the paradigm of which they place before you when they get somebody that grows up in their educational systems they cause them to believe and align thus they go out with a sincere heart begin to fight for that lie global warming you see how that works they actually do believe in global warming those spokespersons because they sincerely believe you can always detect the sincerity that's what keeps it plausible in your mind it's important you understand this process that's how they work how they always have worked is everybody clear on that process like with the government they raise a person telling them lies about the government education they pat them on the back and say job well done and then they place them in a position of power that person wholeheartedly does their job believing in what they're doing they do that so that because you can always sense sincerity i'm telling you that people have been raised into a line you have detected their sincerity which causes you to believe in their cause then it spreads like a virus this is what has happened to the world and it's time that you look beyond it i know there's still some folks back in washington who refuse to admit that climate change is real and on a day like today it's hard to get too worried about it they're folks who will equivocate they'll say you know i'm not a scientist well i'm not either but the best scientists in the world know that climate change is happening our analysts in the intelligence community know climate change is happening our military leaders generals and admirals active duty and retired know it's happening our homeland security professionals know it is happening and our coast guard knows it's happening the science is indisputable we become a slave to a paradigm that's an illusion all of what you see is not real though it has real effects upon your life you are simply maneuvered by a control system that you need to break free of i'm trying to help you before it comes crumbling down and then your heart starts pumping very fast because in your mind you will think that your world came to an end men's hearts will fail them for fear for looking after those things that are coming up on the world that's not from one thing that's from multiple things 2004 global warming at the front pages they already admitted back in 2004 and swept all that under the carpet they didn't know the dynamics of climate change and thus princeton university was charged with the task of coming up with something and coming up with something quick now when you talk about global warming people get this question in their heads they'll say i don't believe in global warming yet it's getting warmer every single year so what they did was they threw out a word and people began to chase and support the word with what's happening in the world the conditions of global warming are absolutely 100 percent real the earth is warming up radiation is building sickness is running rampant all over the earth but why is either forces out there that mankind cannot comprehend 2004 everything started why did it start in two thousand four because that was the impact of a magnetar that's why that was the impact of a magnet magnetar that's when the top of our atmosphere was ripped off by a wave sent by magnetar that's why a piece of our atmosphere was ripped off and you didn't even know it in 2004 nobody talked about that did they anybody discuss that no they didn't oh they had all the instrumentation in the world monitoring it they were scared to death they didn't know what would happen they didn't know but i'm telling you they were deathly afraid because they saw it coming they see a lot of things coming they're not going to tell you for what good would that do you would only get in the way telling you that in 2004 everything changed and that's why in 2005 they the united nations at the climate change conference we know that climate change is the single most important environmental issue facing the world today the scientific evidence on climate change from the integral governmental panel on climate change that met in montreal in september and from many others is more compelling than ever we know that the longer we wait the larger will be the challenge and the damage from climate change the broad-based consensus is that more action is required now how convenient 2004 global warming that that discussion really takes off and in 2005 they had the climate change conference how convenient ever since 2005 what have you noticed a change in weather phenomena a change in earthquake activity a change with the other objects in space that's why we send probes all over the place for proof of something yes but to also monitor we've got satellites and craft orbiting just about everything we can because they serve as an early warning system of what will happen to earth see if something is just indigenous to earth maybe mankind can change it but what we're what we're having is not indigenous to earth it is not just for earth entire solar system is beginning to do a wicked shimmy and solar activity is a telltale sign of the exotic energy that's coming into the solar system the sun acts as a shield to the entire solar system the sun does just as your skin acts as a shield to protect your insides and to keep things away from the precious internal portions of your body right so does the sun create a barrier to keep highly charged particles at bay and every so often it's pierced the skin the skin we could say that envelops our solar system is weakening and things are coming through there's nothing mankind can do about it and it's coming that was december 27th earth was impacted by that blast 2004 december 27th and when you know we have another one coming in december how strange why because there's a phenomenon space called pulses right pulses pulses happen at intervals normally when something blows like a magnet or something like that sends out multiple shock waves it's like a i don't know triple quadruple explosions right well they're headed towards earth from more than one source there's nothing anybody can do about it which is why everybody's watching for the shock wave in october we could have some severe atmospheric problems in october as a shockwave finally passes through earth it is believed right now that shockwave could affect at least one third of our atmosphere as far as the other effects nobody knows we do know that that this thing is just charged with energy because it's coming from a source of almost pure energy 2004 that magnetar just barely skipped us in fact it didn't even touch us but it ripped off a portion of the atmosphere i i tell you this when it passed it was millions of miles away but it still sucked off part of our atmosphere that's a problem i believe the distance of that pulse of magnetar was about the distance from earth to mercury that's the distance you're talking about right i'm sorry twice the distance between earth and mercury it was twice the dis and it still popped off a piece of our atmosphere still even with that distance so can you begin to see what the earth must undergo what it's about to undergo it's not a play thing there were also psychological effects that took place in 2004 that have been evolving since then listen a great war is also on the horizon now they're going to utilize the breakdown and the fracturing of this planet and war will ensue they're going to utilize this heavenly event this event of a breakdown they they're going to use that to their advantage for war the inhabitants of the earth will surely be few i would go so far as to say 50 of humanity in the first phase of this war is going to be dead everybody with me so far just like cern right there is public there's a public uh side of cern and then there's the true side of cern i can assure you nobody's trying to collide little bitty particles and to find out what i can assure you that's not the mission where they're going to cure cancer with it no it all leads back to something else now there is the public side of science of which people are passionate about that's the part they know but listen to me close in every single experiment somebody collects the data who collects the data not everybody's aware of so what they're doing is having people who believe in the experiment giving them a a portion of a job they go out and accomplish that job and spend their lifetime doing it so somebody else can collect the data and they're doing something else with the results but the people on top they only know the experiment they're saying yes we're doing our best in the experiment it works and that's how they get back online and say well you don't know what you're talking about certainly has nothing to do with this that any other that's what the experts will say cern has nothing to do with this that the other why because they're passionate about that compartmentalized task that they have so they accomplish what they're given to accomplish but as a whole they don't know what it's producing there's a portion of science that's a mystery to those folks they're not educated in full sciences why in the world would anybody ever do that if you had knowledge of all things there's no way you could teach others knowledge of all things they wouldn't have a precept for it so those who know the exotic sciences in the rest of the sciences are the ones who are collecting the information doing something with it the particles are already coming through already coming through right it's kind of like a fireplace you light up a fireplace right you get near the fire and you start feeling the heat the fire didn't pass through you you didn't pass through the fire but you feel the heat what is that infrared light or your feeling is light you know that that's what you feel light that's all you're feeling what is that infrared light of radiation is it going to kill you well if you're over exposed to it's going to burn you up but your flesh reacts to the radiation it raises your body temperature by exciting molecules in your flesh though therefore you feel heat heat is movement movement is heat okay you got that heat is movement movement is heat so when you get near something that's infrared the molecules internally begin to move around a lot more and then you feel heat the heat of your body in the same fashion this wave is coming through what it emits the solar system is responding to just like your skin responds to infrared light so does the solar system respond to these exonic particles coming in because the source is coming close the source of these waves is coming close now close does not mean right there where you can see it i can assure you that but prior to you seeing anything this world is going to rumble like you never saw before you telling me the second wave is not going to impact humanity i'm telling you it is in october we're going to find out some details good or bad we'll put them out there you're going to hear many things but it's always good to have your ears open to the holy spirit and the truth that is within you that when it is time to do something you move and when it is not time to do something you stay still because it could be life or death to you that means i don't have the final word on what you must do the lord does not one man on earth has a final word for what you must do the lord knows what you must do and because he said he will never leave you nor forsake you he will instruct you okay so as i go through these things i can only advise but you must have your ear open to the lord because if you don't you're going to follow the advice of man and by that man's word you may die these are

55,_5MhgeVWmWE,"I'm about to show you hidden video footage of people deeply involved in hiv/aids research including Nobel Prize winners for hiv/aids research admitting things about HIV that you would never hear or read anywhere else included is hidden video footage of the man who won a Nobel Prize for discovering HIV claiming openly that HIV is harmless to most people his own words I'm about to expose to you the fraud of HIV testing and how unsuspecting people in Africa who know nothing about human biology or the nature of HIV tests are being deceived and drugged to death by the antiretroviral poisons being fed to them by large pharmaceutical corporations and the criminal individuals who are gaining financially by maintaining the rules let's start by defining AIDS what is AIDS AIDS is an acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids is a weakened immune system that is what aids is now what causes AIDS any number of things if you happen to have multiple bacterial or viral infections or one serious bacterial infection you could end up with AIDS because your immune system could be stressed beyond what it can handle also if your immune system is weak due to malnutrition you would have AIDS yes this means there are millions of people in the world with AIDS without HIV in fact HIV AIDS is a misnomer because as I'm about to uncover for you HIV does not cause AIDS despite what you've been told so you know AIDS is the weakening of the body's immune system by disease or malnutrition now Morrow nutrition is something from which many people in Africa it just so happened to suffer that we have known what causes acquired immune deficiency diseases for at least 70 years it's in the medical textbooks it's there for you to read number one cause on the face of this earth is malnutrition and starvation that's Africa look to the headlines of the October 3rd issue of the London Times Sunday Times last year and the inside headlines it screamed across two pages the plague that never was speak to Philip and Evelyn crimen who had part Taj with an organization of 250 people their own Hospital their own doctors their own laboratories who have lived in the heart of the epidemic supposed to think or the supposed at epidemic for five years there is no epidemic it doesn't exist they are there they're not some character who goes through from the World Health Organization and says oh I've seen the people dying of course you have we all saw them on television in Somalia what do you think you were looking at that was AIDS due to starvation due to malnutrition so they essentially redefine malnutrition as aids in Africa because you don't need an HIV test and so the millions of people in Africa we're told you have this fatal disease and the only cure for it it's not clean water nutritious food all those other things that many Africans do not have it's toxic expensive drugs from the rich country when the hiv/aids craze was first being propagandized by the media worldwide millions upon millions of Africans were fraudulently diagnosed with hiv/aids and prescribed toxic pharmaceutical chemicals intentionally designed to kill them these were malnourished people who quite accurately could be described as having AIDS because they did have AIDS something which had nothing to do with HIV however they were being misled to believe that the drugs men to treat HIV could also treat AIDS because HIV AIDS that was the pharmaceutical companies propagandizing through the mainstream media and the World Health the hiv/aids drugs primarily ezt being given to people are killing them did you know that there is a 100% death rate by immune deficiency amongst each and every single person who takes the HIV AIDS antiretroviral drugs 100% death rate did you know however that each and every single person who has ever refused to take the hiv/aids drugs has lived a healthy life none who refused the drugs died of immune deficiency related causes none whether they are diagnosed with HIV or not I remember in 1992 after I first tested positive I became involved in an organization called women at risk there were 11 of us at the time on the board and involved in the group all of us except three were on the medications in the year and a half that I was involved with women at risk every single woman in that organization on the drugs died every single one except the three of us who weren't taking them a Z T is highly mutagenic meaning that it destroys the genes and cells and has been shown to cause cancer in rodents it targets the bone marrow where B lymphocyte blood cells are being made these are the very cells an AIDS patient needs most for immunity a Z T destroys randomly bone marrow kidneys liver intestines muscle tissue the brain and central nervous system Peter Duesberg claims AZT actually causes AIDS itself ezt deaths does directly causing AIDS and defining diseases you know it says a lot of things but it doesn't cause Kaposi sarcoma I think but it does cause immunodeficiency it was designed to do that it was designed to kill human cells in fact the manufacturer says that specifically that it can cause each like diseases in the manufacturer that is spirits welcomed says it is often difficult to distinguish adverse events possibly associated with sido ruling on Sedova Dean Administration which is a CT from underlying science of HIV disease in other words even they acknowledge nothing just respect that CDV that ECT causes AIDS or insta finding diseases the hiv/aids drugs are the cause of AIDS and when given to anyone who already has AIDS and accelerated death is all it offers when given to healthy people the result is the same it terminates life you terminate DNA you terminate life and they talk about side effects in the insert when are you gonna learn there is no such thing as a side effect in medicine it's an unwanted direct effect and you know what one of the unwanted direct effects of AZT is lymphoma cancer one of the diseases of AIDS as they call it oh so called side effect which is really an unwanted direct effect pan cytokine iya you need a definition pancytopenia pan all Saito's cells pina loss of loss of all your cells that's AIDS that is the definition of AIDS so AZT by definition by their own drug insert causes AIDS and nobody survives AZT that will eventually lead to your death and they've cut the dosage way down because it was killing them too fast it's like giving somebody a large dose of strychnine and they die within 5 minutes and so the next person you give them as a few drops of it and they last 4 or 5 days and you say strychnine is a wonderful drug this person last five times longer the mass poisonings of unsuspecting Africans were going on in Africa behind everyone else's backs in the West while people in the West were being told that Africans had hiv/aids the propagandists needed to continuously fraudulently mention HIV and AIDS together to create a false link between those words and justify their proclamations of an AIDS epidemic in Africa one wish they manufactured entirely there is not a single scientific paper which claims categorically that HIV causes AIDS not a single reference anyway in the scientific literature because HIV does not cause aids to claim in a scientific paper that HIV causes AIDS could easily incur lawsuits when the aforementioned statement is proven to be false because it is false however the media keeps saying HIV causes AIDS and people write articles claiming HIV causes AIDS but none of them can give you a reference to the scientific literature which asserts that statement as fact all you will find is other deceptive propaganda pieces written under the guise of someone's opinion but written deceptively to defraud laypeople [Music] the first time I really questioned it I was working on a project where we were measuring HIV in people's blood at this place called specialty laboratories in Santa Monica I was just in a consultant there and I came in about three days a month and we were working on that and at some point we needed to re-up our grant from the NIH to work on that and I had to write it and so the first line of that was HIV is the probable cause of AIDS I wrote that and then I said well I need a paper some kind of scientific paper to reference that statement cuz when you make a sign to a statement like that's like a fact so you need to say here's how come I know that all right you put a little one if it's the first statement you've made and then you put down at the bottom the paper you have a 1 you say here's a paper by somebody that describes why that statement is true all right and so I said that's well what's that I don't know man think about what is that paper who do I go to for that and I looked around I asked a couple of our ologists that company and they said no you know I took reference I thought I have to reference that because I don't know I don't know where that came from how do I know that and it turned out that nobody knew it there wasn't a scientific reference like a a paper that somebody has submitted with like experimental data in it and like logical discussion and said here's how come we know that HIV is the probable cause of AIDS there's nothing left there like that nothing we've talked about AIDS and the fact that HIV does not cause it but let's talk about HIV is HIV HIV is a supposed retrovirus supposedly discovered by Robert Gallo and Luc Montaigne interesting the HIV according to the people who claimed to have discovered it is harmless to most people we can be exposed to HIV many times without being chronically infected our immune system greedy a fatal virus within a few weeks if you have a good image system if you have a good immune system then your body can naturally get rid of HIV yes if you take a poor African who's been infected and you build up the immune system is it possible for them to also naturally get rid of it I would think so that's an important that's an important it's important knowledge which is completely negated you know people always think of drugs and vaccine so this semester which may be different from the there but you were before no no no they yes my message is different from what you had from Fiji oh yes so HIV does not cause AIDS and as revealed by the man who discovered it himself HIV is harmless to most people but how is HIV even tested well there are a number of ways and none of these tests work you because of these different criteria that apply in different countries you couldn't be considered you can test hiv-positive in one country and be given an AIDS diagnosis as a result of that whereas in another country you won't test hiv-positive and you won't be given an AIDS diagnosis it's ludicrous that you can be positive in one country and not positive in another theoretically I could be diagnosed with AIDS in the United States but if I take three steps to my right I wouldn't be diagnosed with AIDS or I would lose my AIDS diagnosis when I cross the border 30,000 Russians who tested positive for HIV were then tested with another test that's supposedly far more accurate to confirm the positivity and 66 out of 30,000 prove to be positive that means that the test HIV is 99.997% inaccurate you want to take a test that's three thousandth of a percent right and you're gonna rely on that but that's what they're doing to people out there they're taking a test that is not only invalid it's totally misleading in fact when you get results like that then I would say you're going to be more correct that if your red is being negative consider yourself positive and if you're positive consider yourself negative by the way at the request of many individuals I did go for a test a couple of weeks ago in New York City at the biggest clinic there that does more testing than anybody else and the doctor who ran it was bragging about the fact that he did more when I told him about the book I wrote he said don't say anything my patients might hear in the scientific paper luc montagnier rob gallo and his associates wrote they claim that HIV might be the cause of AIDS however the HIV AIDS propagandists used the media to make false reports that HIV did in fact cause AIDS even though there was no scientific evidence for that and there were no scientific claims of that thus allowed criminals like Rob gallo and his associates to spread the HIV AIDS line through the media and brainwashed society without being held accountable lawsuit not that the general public knew anything about HIV to sue anyone but in case they did Gallo and his scumbag friends could say we never said HIV causes AIDS the media did interestingly rob Gallo in the scientific paper in which he took part did in fact initially say that HIV causes AIDS he was subsequently found guilty of fraud for making that statement because that statement was false and devoid of any scientific evidence whatsoever additionally he was found guilty of misconduct for lying about and misrepresenting his peers before fraudulently involving himself with hiv/aids rob Gallo had been involved in cancer research where he ridiculously attempted to prove that the cause of cancer was a retrovirus naturally his research yielded no results and was a monumental failure none of the viruses he studied could be linked to cancer however when aids started to become sensationalized by the media for its apparently pervasive existence amongst homosexual men Gallo would later seize upon the opportunity to clear many media announced meant with no scientific evidence whatsoever by the way that a variant of one of the cancer-causing viruses he was researching was the cause of AIDS it was from there that the attention-seeking Rob gallo would make a false name for himself for discovering HIV he went from the unsubstantiated claim that cancer was caused by a retrovirus to the unsubstantiated claim that a variant of the non-existent cancer-causing virus was the cause of AIDS additionally this virus is one which he frozen t claimed to be his discovery when in fact he blatantly stole it from team of French scientists of whom Luc montagnier the now co-discoverer of the retrovirus was a member writing the world wind of public demand Gallo made his move on April 23rd 1984 Secretary of Health and Human Services Margaret heckler and Robert gallo called a press conference together that would involve the United States Department of Health and what critics claimed would become the biggest medical scientific blunder of all time first the probable cause of AIDS has been found variant of a known human cancer virus called h LT htlv III with htlv 3 gallows white elephant virus program made the jump from the cause of cancer to become the cause of AIDS and that target of billions of dollars in research funds simultaneously as the press conference was going on the blood test used to detect HIV was being patented which would earn the US Department of Health over a hundred million dollars a year and large financial kickbacks to Robert gallo the AIDS industry was born and the US government was now fully invested naively secretary heckler predicted that a vaccine would be ready for testing by 1986 we hope to have such a vaccine ready for testing in approximately two years for the moment everyone was happy about this discovery of the probable cause of AIDS gay activists were satisfied that the government was finally doing something but the public was not aware that Gallo had bypassed a major checkpoint before making his announcement he had not submitted his test results to other scientists for peer-review no one had a chance to critique or verify his claim and his test results were not published in science magazine until one week after the press conference this was a dangerous violation of scientific protocol suddenly a challenge to gallows ethics emerged which would become an international scandal the institut pasteur ER in paris claimed that Gallo's aids virus was identical to La Vie a virus dr. Luke Montaigne had sent gallows lab six months before the press conference the French were outraged and filed an international lawsuit against the US Health Department on grounds that Gallo had pirated their discovery the entire incident was embarrassing to the United States and had to be resolved diplomatically by President Reagan and prime ministers Jacques Chirac of France it is only because the French government saw the massive potential to make money from the so-called HIV virus that they refrained from suing the United States alongside Gallo and convinced Luc Montaner to join Gallo as a co-discoverer of HIV with this arrangement to split the profits made on the HIV blood test the virus was given a new international name the human immunodeficiency virus or HIV despite questions of Gallo's character and ethics HIV had now gained international acceptance Rob Gallo the man who claims to discover the HIV virus is known fraud a failed scientist a thief and a known liar let that sink in for a second there is not a single scientific document which claims HIV causes any serious disease whatsoever none in fact Kary Mullis the very man who is responsible for inventing the HIV test has admitted there is no body of evidence that supports the claim that HIV causes any disease whatsoever HIV is a lie but what about the individuals who have perpetrated this lie they are all multimillionaires they have made huge investments in this theory their careers their papers their students their academic standing and not the least of it they're huge commercial interests all of almost all of my peers on the right side of the hypothesis on the other side of the other with the right hypothesis have huge commercial conflicts of interest that are not a quarter carefully not mentioned by the press of the journals they have stocks in those welcome they have stocks see it's not an accident that these campuses like ours are surrounded by biotechnology companies Chiron and Genentech like metastasis like a tumor by metastasis they go there and they have their stocks there and they triple the income if that is enough so they pay their their huge homes on the hill their Porsches their Carreras the mistresses what have you that comes all from so these are all investments that are based on their professional on their science on their professional investments ",3
56,BEWz4SXfyCQ,"- one boom and we're live first of all cheers gentlemen let's have a little toast relax Bob thank you very much for doing this I really appreciate it I understand that you've told this story many many times you've been grilled many many times and it's very stressful for you so I really really appreciate your time for people who don't know the story there is a documentary Jeremy Korbel it has a documentary out right now it's called bob lazar area 51 in UFOs and flying saucers and flying saucers air 51 in flight sometimes I first heard your story decades ago I've told you last night we went out to dinner I've seen pretty much every interview you've ever given I've followed the story incredibly closely but for people who don't know story let's give them the bullet points you used to work at area 51 and area 51 you got you you went like huh well you know we want to be accurate Oh Kerry S 4 s 4 oh just about 15 miles south of area 51 okay um you worked in what would you how would you describe it I guess within the area 51 compound you can call that a subset of area 51 and you got that job before that you were working before that I had worked at Los Alamos right National Labs in New Mexico and you were involved in what kind of work the nuclear weapon development physics I mean that's they do everything there so how did they approach you to say hey bomb once you come on out to the Nevada desert well the way this went down was at that time I was 1982 I I put a jet engine in my my Honda and Los Alamos put it on the front page of the paper said you know Los Alamos man physicist at the lab you know built this 200 mile an hour you know on the jet car that I drove to work every day so I was known in Los Alamos that the guy with the weird car and you know you could hear it from you know a mile away anyway the day that came out on the front page of the paper was the day Edward Teller the father of the hydrogen bomb was giving a lecture down there at the lab and we didn't have much going on that day in our group and I asked if I could go down there and I went down there early and Ed teller was outside leaning on a brick wall there and reading the front page of the paper now there's a guy out of history so I introduced myself hey I'm the guy you're reading about there and we talked for a little while and it was cool you know fast forward two years later I had moved out to Las Vegas and had you know left Los Alamos and you know went on to other things and I wanted to get back into the scientific humanity yeah I left start other businesses and and that sort of thing so I sent resumes out and one of them went out to Ed teller and referenced our meeting you know back it back in that the day and anyway he remembered me and gave me a reference somebody to contact at EG&G and that's pretty much how it started so you get a phone call or a letter like what do you get well I got a what did I get I got a letter initially and went down for an interview probably a couple times and it was down at EG&G special projects which was at McCarran Airport at that time out in Las Vegas and did they give you any sort of job description of what you were applying for they said it was for Edie I can't remember exactly what they did this was a long time ago but I I think it was advanced propulsion or something like that something relatively generic and they said it's in a remote area you know it's gonna be some days on some days off and you know it was kind of a it was kind of not exactly a full-time job but you might have to be out there for two weeks at a time and take two weeks off so kind of uh the work schedule would be kind of broken up and did this seem attractive you or did it seem weird no I really wasn't weird because people that work at the test site anybody that's familiar with the area up there you know working at the nuclear test site or at the Tonopah test range north of there that's typically how things go so you had known about it from the scientific community because the area 51 at that time know anything about area 51 okay so they just said it was in a you know in a remote location and you just know it was up at the test site right so but there was no mention of area 51 at that time so they've done hundreds of nuclear tests in Nevada Nevada that that whole area was there's been just giant chunks of Nevada the people yeah there's a big piece of Nevada and it split up into different areas there's a nuclear test site there's area 51 there's the Tonopah test range north of that there's little sub areas there's areas where they test chemical weapons and things like that so it's all broken up as a you know gigantic test area so take me back to first day on the job you accept a job they take you out there yeah it's the first day really I didn't really get to see a whole lot the first day was essentially just paperwork that's when I flew into area 51 proper and I left McCarran Airport and flu what they call the Janet flights just you know a passenger plane from Las Vegas to area 51 and it was really just going through a mountain of paperwork that day from security clearances to cat there was it was like two or three hours of just solid paperwork and that was that was really an uneventful first day when did things get weird when did you realize they at what point in time did you say hey this is not normal work like this doesn't even seem like it's from this planet that I can't tell you what day that occurred on because so much time has gone by the days of kind of fusion to and I can't listen today's was it a slow burn or was there a moment of recognition well they're the the first inkling I had was when I I came in normal there's this facility that is at s4 it's in the side of a mountain and normally we had pulled in with the bus and gone around the front through a normal double door this time that I went in there were hanger doors open I went into the hangar door and in the hangar door was the disk the flying saucer that I worked on I saw it sitting there and we walked by a headed little American flag stuck on the side and I thought oh my god this finally explains all the flying saucer stories this is just an advanced fighter and it this is [ __ ] hilarious so I went by I sloughs my hands alongside it I got reprimanded immediately for touching the thing and there was a guy in armed guard that followed us in and just said keep your eyes at forward in your hands at your side and just walk in the door so that was the first time I had seen anything that was weird it was sometime later that I was introduced to my my lab partner Barry and we had some of the subcomponents of the craft in the lab and Barry was very anxious to get a new lab partner so he was very talkative and couldn't wait to show me different things and it was in the demonstration of the reactor working where it caught my attention to where this is technology that doesn't even exist so I mean that was the first time I knew that this is really something different what was it what was it what was a what was it about this reactor that made you think that it didn't exist technologically well it was that I actually have to back up because there were some briefings that I read it before that that you know certainly gave me the impression that this was going to be a weird job but this was the first hands-on thing this was a small reactor about the size of a hemisphere about the size of a basketball on a metal plate and when it was running it produced a gravitational field a gravitational field of its own now this is something that we can't do we can't produce any gravity the only way we get gravity is from large quantities of mass but there's no machine we can have that turns on that makes gravity like you know you can turn on an electromagnet and it makes a magnetic field we can't make a gravitational field anyway this device was producing that and Barry said it's almost like he was bragging go ahead try and try and touch the sphere and I I couldn't it would it pushed my hands away just like two like poles of a magnet so that was like when you take two magnets and try to press them together yeah yeah kind of cushion feeling but you can't you can't get them together the closer you put them the more they push but you felt that physical with my hand yeah now there's nothing there's nothing that does that and that immediately caught my attention going wow this is something else what was your thought like when you felt that and you knew that there was nothing that you were aware of that could predict that connected me to the briefings that I read on the the first day at s4 was that you know everything that I had read was apparently accurate what were you reading I read it was kind of an overview this project was to back engineer the alien craft and specifically it was to try and back engineer and see if we can duplicate the technology with available materials now to do this they split the project into you know many different pieces for several reasons they do this on all classified project so nobody has the complete story but they compartmentalize everything now we had the power and propulsion system so what briefings they gave me were like a one or two page overview of some of the other projects that were going on you know on the craft the only reason they do that is just in case what you're working on is connected intimately in some way that we don't know of - one of the other projects you have to know there excuse me their existence so you know I bet again everything from metallurgy - you know weapon potential the craft and these were all you know essentially very short briefings but mine was just power and propulsion and it made it very clear that what I read was accurate so when you're reading that before you actually saw the reactor what were your thoughts on what they were describing if you knew that something like that didn't exist and they're describing it in the briefings what did you think you were gonna see I really I didn't know at the time I mean I was reading I thought is this is some kind of test see if you're crazy well not to see if I'm crazy - you know a lot of times they'll take in real high security jobs I mean they'll intentionally insert nonsense into him whether it's to confuse the fact or if for someone was to leak it out they would carry that information along and know where it came from so I read through the documents but you know I didn't know if this was you know part of some kind of test or you know or what or was it potentially realistic I mean I'd really didn't consider it being all that possible as far as being the actual thing that I was going to work on at the time how did they turn it on there the reactor yeah the reactor can be turned on or turned off in a lot of different ways the way Barry showed me it the hemisphere is removed there's a small tower in the middle when you put the hemisphere on the reactor activates the reactor shuts down its its load sensing so if there's if there's no load on the reactor at all it shuts down when there's a load present on it it starts up again load meaning you can consider it an electrical load so although it doesn't necessarily operate electrically there's no wiring that connects any of the sub components together whatsoever they just have to be in the immediate vicinity it's a it is but the stuff is borderline magic and that's essentially where we left it you know when I left the project so there was no progress made there was some progress I mean we did identify at least we think some processes and and had a rough idea we think of what was going on but I think this is a problem that they've had for a long time and you know I was replacing somebody that Barry worked with prior to me and I think there was some horrific accident that I didn't have a whole lot of information on but you know Barry alluded to that a horrific accident like where someone died or yeah where somebody died because they were trying to tamper with things or figure out how something worked yeah the reactor in particular but yet he let you touch it yeah I think what they were trying to do was cut into one now they had they had more than one there and I that was supposedly there was an unannounced nuclear test and that's what it was at the time remember they would still do an underground nuclear test at the test site but from what I understand according to Barry there was an attempt made now this must have been a pretty desperate attempt because it's not a very scientific process to cut you know analyze something that way but it looked like they used a plasma cutter or something I got to cut into an exactor how many of these things they have they had nine nine craft altogether I only got hands-on with one of them so I can't really say what the how the others operated you see the other ones yeah at one time and only one time the bay doors that between the hangars were all open and I could see all the way through and were they all exactly the same no they were all different different shapes yeah but they were all from somewhere else yeah absolutely now did anyone make any attempt to explain or to to tell you where they came from no no no one is the least bit interested in letting everybody know all the facts they want to give you the minimum information that's necessary to complete your task so you're not getting the story of where they came from you're not getting the story of what how much progress other people are making you just focus on the small component but they gave you some indication that they've been working on these for a while yeah when do you think they acquired these I really couldn't say I think they've been around for a while so they bring you into this room you see this reactor working you you realize this is nothing that as far as like the scientific community at current time has the ability to create wait you still don't what is your life like from that moment on is that where everything changes because you do I mean I would imagine the moment you actually make contact with something that's extraterrestrial whether it's an object or a being something where you can actually absolutely be certain it's not from here your whole paradigm the whole world you live in is now a different place well this is the only time it became exciting you know the rest of the time though it was really an an ominous feeling being at work but it at that time it was exciting I mean this was now I knew we were on the absolute beyond actually beyond the cutting edge of science and I was I was so absolutely excited to be there every single time I was you know it with this was a fantastic opportunity and however in in short order it began to concern me we really have no idea what we're talking about and the excitement kind of turned to dread at some point because the amount of power we're dealing with is astronomical I mean to affect gravity to produce the effects like this equipment does takes huge amounts of power and I've given the example before of you know taking a small portable nuclear reactor and you know putting it back into Victorian times you know with the scientists at the time and just dropping it in a room and they come and look at it and see that it's producing power and wonder how it works so they start taking it apart and as soon as they get some of the shielding off the people are going to drop dead because of the radiation inside now the people have no idea that it radiation even exists back then but anybody that comes in to check on them will also drop dead and you know there's no reason that that exact scenario couldn't happen with what we're dealing with we have no idea how the physics operate within this thing the power levels are art like I said astronomic like it's incredibly dangerous to tinker with something like that and you know in some respects we were guinea pigs just try to find out how to make this thing so they had a series as far as you surmised that a series of different scientists try to back engineer this thing try to figure out what this thing was and they would bring in new people and like let's throw Bob at it yeah yeah and they I know I don't know how many but I knew there was certainly one before me and I knew he died during the analysis of the or the reactor itself and you don't know how many have worked on it and no one gave this could have been there for 50 years it could have been there for five years when they give you instructions what are they saying like when they're giving you direction they're showing you all this stuff like what what what are they saying well specifically what are they asking of you well essentially what they ask is is what I said we are just to gather as much information as possible find out how it operates and see if we can duplicate it so but they notice relays you where it was from they never let you ask questions about where it's from well if the information I read in the briefings was accurate now what I do have to say is the information that pertained directly to the reactor was accurate what I read did I mean did jive with reality in terms of how in terms of how it was made how what we saw how it operated the materials how it you know turned on and what was discovered discovered about it I'm sorry the migraine is really making it hard for me to thank you sorry no we we talked that before the podcast you tell everybody Bob getting a migraine I know you're very stressed out by this is just one of the reasons why I appreciate you doing this where was I already we're talking right the plaintiff and so there was some paperwork that indicated that this was from the Zeta Reticuli star system now yeah now how they obtained that I haven't I haven't the slightest idea but it wasn't just from the Zeta Reticuli star system it was what they called zr3 so it was a third planet in that star system so there was no other information about it other than that supposedly where the craft came from now was that true I don't know I have no way of verifying that but that was printed in the same materials that referenced the reactor now I looked that stuff up when I went home and Zeta Reticuli is a binary star two stars that orbit orbit one another and it's only visible in the southern hemisphere and it's about thirty some-odd light-years away so that's literally all the information I have about that I don't know how they found out it came from there and you also probably have some suspicions that they give you some disinformation like you were talking about before yeah yeah I mean if you ever decided to talk about this they added a bunch of nonsense to make whatever is factual look ridiculous right or be able to trace it down like okay this fax came out and you know this Lazar guy said okay you know came from Zeta Reticuli so they knew it was when he read Isaiah reticulate we like what in the [ __ ] is this well reading all of the stuff it was what kind of [ __ ] is this you like why did I sign up for this no no I would dit to me this was cool this was interesting I said I was just excited to be out in a secure area you know in the middle of the desert is awesome how old are you I get as in my 20s yeah so you probably totally geeked out oh yeah it's that this was this was great I mean I was excited so I didn't care I'm reading through everything and so you read through all the Zeta particularly thing but then when you see the actual starship with the little American flag sticker on it well that was was that later or before that that was before so before so you see the thing before you say oh that's that before it's hard so many years yeah I can't either way it doesn't matter the days have fused together it's so hard to separate what happened in each visit do you remember the thought process when you read that it's from Zeta Reticuli yeah it it it it didn't hit me like a ton of bricks or anything is just like yeah okay [ __ ] I don't know these were now I don't I mean because when I read it I hadn't verified anything and this was just a bunch of stuff I was reading and I thought maybe after this they're just gonna give me a test and see what I can remember and write crazy information and it would but like I said when I finally went in with Barry and had hands-on experience with what they were talking about it took on a completely different meaning so there's a plate there's this thing that looks like half a basketball and when it's on you can't come anywhere near it you can't touch it right how is what is gravity about that like the concept of gravity most people's gravity is bringing something towards it right well I guess you would say it's anti-gravity it's gravity shifted 180 degrees it's a you know antigravity and did they have any understanding about what could possibly create this effect did they have any areas where they'd like you to look into no they well they knew there was a fuel source in it and they were proficient at making it work and again my analogy to something like this is you can drop a motorcycle off in the wagon train days and just leave it with the keys parked outside you know somebody's place everybody will come around it and they'll poke and prod and eventually they'll turn the key get it to start and become proficient at writing it yeah but they won't be able to understand what the hell's going on they won't be able to make the plastic fender much less anything else and I think that's exactly the state we were at we played around with the parts long enough before I got there where they could make the reactor operate take the fuel out and know that it makes it work how exactly what was going on in the reactor remained a mystery at the time I think we made some progress on what was going on inside but I don't think anybody really knew anything they could just watch what was going on and make note of it how long were there I'd say about six months or so and what what progress admit was made while you were there well we came up with a bunch of reasonably good ideas about how the reactor worked and one of them was the base the square base of it was essentially like a cyclotron which is a small particle accelerator a circular one particle accelerators of linear particle accelerators are just a you know long tube essentially in the accelerate particles with high voltage and you know radio frequencies till they reach high speeds but a cyclotron does that in a small circular area and there's this very heavy element fuel element 115 something that wasn't on our periodic charts at the time but it is now it is now yeah when did it become on the periodic table now the way their charts now you know I don't remember do you remember when they 2004 Durham Germany I think is where they first advocated for atoms that lasted 220 milliseconds the atoms it's nothing right and then later was discovered a couple more times they could fabricate it then they gave it they gave it a place then on the Periodic Chart after that called it moscovia so they told you about this stuff in 1982 yeah well what what year was this it was 80 88 and 89 when I was there 82 is 182 it was near Los Alamos I'm sorry yeah so 88 89 they told you about this stuff so this was not like no they didn't they didn't tell me about it that's one of the things that this group came up with mmm the guy I keep losing my train of thought with this thing so this one area this this element 115 was the fuel yeah it was the fuel that the world will forgive you for having a migraine yes really I didn't think that'd give you more person so I say what yeah definitely as I said one thing you know bought for the last 30 years people have just been on the attack on Bob you know getting to know him the personal effects on his life it's really hard to understand unless you meet his family and his wife I mean this is the last thing he wanted to [ __ ] do was have to talk yeah we should explain that chairman the you and I had this conversation I watched a documentary we had this conversation and I said I have to talk to him yeah the document there was there's been detractors there's been a bunch of people that called [ __ ] on many of the things that you've said but over time many of the things that you talked about even in the 80s have proven to be true things that people said we're not true were proven to be true element 115 was one of them right right right element 115 the fuel they had was stable in other words it didn't decay it wasn't emitting radioactivity when they synthesized two or three atoms of the 115 it did decay and it was not a stable element so they're they're kind of two different things but this is kind of typical elements always have or pretty much always have stable isotopes and unstable isotopes like I think cesium has like 30 unstable isotopes to it so all right well hydrogen for example you're familiar with hydrogen gas it's stable it's not radioactive but there's also two other types of hydrogen deuterium and tritium and deuterium isn't radioactive it's another stable isotope of hydrogen but tritium is radioactive now they're all hydrogen but they just have different amounts of neutrons so it's the same thing with other elements and element 115 depending on the amount of neutrons it has designates the isotope but it's 115 they will continue to take or experiment and try and make 115 at different isotopes and I'm sure eventually they'll come up with a stable version but it's the taste stable version that has the properties that we're talking about so they somehow or another had acquired a stable version did they say that the stable version had come with this crap it absolutely came with the graft yeah so at the time you having a firm knowledge of the periodic chart and knowing what was real and what wasn't real what was your reaction to having this stable element 115 that wasn't even supposed to exist well everything was impossible right I mean down down to the metal I I did get a chance to look inside the craft on only one occasion and this was important because where the reactor sat might have been critical to how it operated since everything operates without any interconnections so the placement of components might be critical so they allowed me to go inside and and look at it again I forgot where the hell I am so you're going into this craft and what are you thinking when you're inside of it like what are you seeing it's a it's a very ominous feeling because it's there are no at first of all everything is one color it's like a dark pewter color and there are no right angles anywhere it's as if somebody took I've said this before somebody took a model out of and fashioned it out of wax and then heated it just for a short time so everything melted everything looks like it's fused together everything has a radius of curvature were two items meet it's it's a really weird looking thing but there was almost nothing other than a small foldable hatchway that that looked recognizable everything was uh was really unworldly to pick on it a way to describe it so you you get inside this thing and it's designed for something that's much smaller than a human being yeah you can't really stand up till you get to the very center of how tall you I'm five ten and what do you think this was designed for I'd say something close to half my height Wow so these little three-foot tallest creatures yeah and that the seats were small too I mean obviously it was made you know for something something small but there is no like there's there's nothing else in there there's just seats the reactor and some of the sub components there's no there's no control panels there's no bathroom there's no no decorative components or artwork or anything that you would recognize or trim I mean it's just a very bare-bones thing you're not seeing any screens well there are archways around it at that a part of the superstructure and that one of the archways can become transparent when I was in there there was another group working on one of the archways and you could call that a screen more or less so through that archway it would be it would maintain the solidity the the solid whatever metal it was yeah but you could just became transparent yeah I saw that happen once or twice before I left did you ask any questions about what the phone no there's no ask question now but when you watch something become transparent and you realize it's still there but you could now see through it yeah I mean no that's not that impressive we do have some liquid crystal materials that are like that you know smart glass yeah they call it smart class so this is just and I don't know if the craft is made of you know an advanced metal or a ceramic it was cold to the touch so um you know I would lean more towards a metal you're not allowed to ask questions no the only way work on the buddy system so I can only exchange ideas and talk to Barry now this really interferes with science because science is based on free discussion and ideally you get a bunch of guys together exchange ideas work on problems and that's how things move forward but they're so over-the-top concerned about security they split everything off and everybody becomes stagnant it it it destroys any of the progress you can make or at least makes it go so slow they I think they wind up shooting themselves in the foot which is probably why they arrived at this bottleneck that they need to get this madman with a jet-powered Honda come in and see what he could do I think that was an act of desperation I think they wanted someone that's thinks out of the box and let's just give this guy a try here because they weren't and they might have done this four more times since you know up to the point in time today assuming they're still working on this thing and when you see this craft and you're inside was there any indication that there was an area that they would use to control it to pilot was there a pilot seat whizzers there were three seats they sat around the reactor was in the dead center of it and then equidistant around there were three seats so that's all the there was a large you would they're not consoles there are large rectangular objects also spaced equidistant around the center there's nothing on them there's no button that there's no lights and they litter all same color this everything is the same color different shape right and directly underneath them there's three levels in the craft the main level is what we're talking about directly under that those are the gravity amplifiers the big rectangular objects underneath them are the gravity of midders that look like for lack of a better word a trash can hanging on a pipe three of those and then the top layer I this is just my personal belief I think that has to do with a navigation or their version of a computer with some planar panels sensor panels around the craft that we would call portholes but they're not portholes they're just black areas and I think that just determines its you know position in space but I was I was in the center section and I stuck my torso in the bottom section and hung upside down so I could see how the gravity amplifiers were positioned what is they the roughly the size of this thing it's I think it I don't member from being there but after all the stuff was over I had John Andrews a guy from the testers model corporation and you know we sat down and tried to figure out from what I saw and known sizes of things and we came up with 52 feet in diameter I think that's always small yeah so I think that's a fair reasonable guess now you said there's nine of them and you got a brief glimpse at the other ones were they how were they different Oh they looked completely different one looked like I called a jello mold and it it looked like a classic jello mold with the rippled sides do it one was a very flat disc you know like oh I don't like a straw hat or something like that that was sitting up on its edge and the thin part of it had looked like a projectile had been fired through the edge of it so I don't know if they were attempting to see if the metal could be penetrated or if something or if that's where the thing came from maybe it was shot down but that was the only one where I saw there was you know actual physical damage to it and that one was roughly the same size they're all high they were kind of too far away to tell mm-hmm and did there was several teams that were working on the propulsion system so there was different teams that were working on these different our aircrafts I I don't don't know I could only assume now when you're sitting in this thing and you're looking at this otherworldly craft your your goal is to try to figure out how this thing functions your goal is to try to figure out how this reactor I mean he would imagine they would give you more time than just one day to check that out oh yeah it wasn't one day right yeah I mean this is Barry was there I think Barry was sleeping there I'm sure they had now that that isn't weird I mean Oh put the Tonopah test range where they work on stealth fighters you know you go I think three weeks on one week off and you stay up there too so it's not weird to stay up with the test site right so yeah you think he prettier than he did like he's been up there for a long time yeah but I'm still there yeah oh no so you do you have contact with this guy no oh no I wish I did I kind of thought he was gonna come out after I did right and I think I took so much flak and it's so much [ __ ] for what went on I think I actually I wound up helping security there and everybody became afraid of you know doing or saying anything after that so what kind of reports did you have to give like so you're not making much progress right you're just trying to figure out what this thing is and it seems impossible so well we didn't personally make them I mean we were always there was never a lot of information that we gained the guy you would call him our supervisor or his name was Dennis Mariani and kind of a military looking guy and he would routinely pop in you know during the day and you know hey what's going on guys and he would essentially relay any information anything new we came up with I mean he was our goal between you know where we presented him the information then he took it to wherever they were you know assembling all the data from everybody know I assume you're working normal day so I can eight-hour day no no no it was really weird that I would be only called in on certain times in certain days and they would be weird hours too most of the time was later in the evening I mean I can get a call with 11 o'clock at night and they'll say you know it's now 11 o'clock by 11:45 you need to be at McCarran Terminal and you know we'll let you know when we have more information but what did you do while you were there if you're looking at this object this reactor and you can't figure out what it is or how it works other than the fact that works on this element that we don't even know about sure I mean the thing was - that what you do and you know with anything if you're trying to analyze it all you can do is perform tests and all we did is try and come up with every kind of test we possibly could I mean we tested you know it violated a lot of what we thought was impossible to violate I mean one of the first laws of thermodynamics I mean essentially any machine any device that operates always makes extra heat nothing works at a hundred percent efficient even the headphones you're wearing anything that takes power some of that power is going to be converted to heat and it's just wasted this didn't I mean we looked at back then we had infrared cameras they're different today but back then you had a pour liquid nitrogen into the camera to cool the sensor down and and get these infrared images you've seen but it never got no matter what the load was on the reactor it never got above ambient temperature which is impossible I mean you're you know pulling out huge amounts of power and nothing ever gets warm we tried measuring magnetic fields and there was was nothing there so we started playing around with the emission from the emitter is the gravity wave itself and saw what we could do with it and how it was focused so we really spent all our time just trying to see what the stuff can do and what we can control so you were seeing what it could do but you couldn't ever figure out how it was doing it no not really I mean we really we really could only use a come up with a best guess and now I can't say we really I that I could absolutely state for certainly very certainty how anything actually worked now how did you know at all how they were piloting it because some they were doing some tests where they were having these things fly around in the sky and this is what gets us deeper into your story right I was out there for one test right in fact I was in with Barry in the lab and Dennis came in and said we're about to run a test why don't you guys come out or I think he said Barry wedding you come out here and bring Bob with you we went out there and the craft was already outside the hangar and was just preparing to lift off now they were in communication with somebody in the craft so there was a person in there yeah there was certainly a person in there now it's not a comfortable place to be in because it's small so the guy has to be sitting on the floor in the middle my best guess and this is the same specific craft that you know that was because you were the that was the only craft that you were the only one that I touched and worked on and it it quietly lifted off the ground which wasn't incredibly impressive to see quietly or silently what's well quietly because it it produced a little Corona discharge from the bottom a corona discharge is kind of a high voltage brush little bluish glow discharge as it was lifting off the ground you can hear a slight hiss sound now as soon as it cleared the ground by about five or ten feet maybe even less than that the hissing stopped and the blue go disappeared so it lifted off quietly and then it hovered silently if you want to be specific Wow so then what kind of maneuvers was it doing it took for that particular time it took off moved a little round around to the left and right and then sat back down the the craft itself they communicated with it with a rake because I saw the guy talking and a regular VHF radio to the person in the craft and I even saw the frequency that was on the frequency counter of the communication the transceiver there but what's weird is he shouldn't be able to communicate with the craft with a radio the radio the radio waves should Bend around the craft I mean it shouldn't be possible every single thing about these the craft and the way they operated didn't make any sense to us I mean that's something we talked about for a while after why should the frequency Bend around the craft well you really have to look at the way the gravity wave comes out of the craft as a the reactors in the center and there's a waveguide that goes up to the top there's actually a small appendage that sticks out at the top of the craft and it produces a heart-shaped gravitational distortion around the craft now if the craft is sitting in the air and you walk underneath it and look up you actually cannot see the craft the light bends around it you're bending gravity bends light it bends radio waves it's um it it shouldn't be possible to communicate with a craft that has an envelope around it that's distorting all forms of energy but they were apparently in contact with it somehow or another through some unexplained way but they bother explain to you so this thing gets up it just does some very simple maneuvers left-right left-right Goes Down and did they discuss this with you I mean they said they wanted you to see it no they just wanted no they didn't discuss anything with me it said it sat down we looked around for a bit and Barry said let's go back we went back in the lab all we got to do is see it fast forward to some months later I did have the test flight schedule of the craft now they had times they had designated high performance tests this obviously wasn't one that was a high performance test the high performance test went goes above the mountain range and they do much more radical moves with the thing look this is a prized item and they're not doing anything like taking it out of the atmosphere or flying around other countries or anything like this they just play with this thing right over the test site but they were doing some radical moves with it and since I had the test flight scheduled statistically the amount of traffic and the surrounding areas on the highway was lowest on Wednesdays and that's why Denny Dennis told us that all the test flights occurred only on Wednesdays because it'd be the least chance that anyone would see what's going on and this was before the the government had expanded the forbidden territory around area 51 and Papoose Lake and all that stuff right yeah I think that occurred after my story came out then people started going up on the mountaintops and trying to look down into there and they kind of freaked out and then did the land grab and pushed everybody back but yeah that I think all that occurred long after I'm sorry that I came out so you're working there and while you're working there you're under this crazy schedule but forgive me for explaining your story but you would get these phone calls you would have to go to the to the airport at 11:00 p.m. and your wife started thinking that you were having an affair yeah apparently so now I did give my permission to have you know as part of the you know security clearance process I gave written permission to have the phones monitored and things of that sort so they weren't doing any covert stuff they you know with any Q clearance tour which is civilian top secret clearance or military top secret clearance they go talk to friends and you know play places you've been make sure you're not connected to foreign countries but you know monitoring your phone is nothing unusual however they insisted that you know you don't even talk to your loved one to your partner to your wife whatever about what's going on so she was essentially in the dark and didn't know the phone was being monitored well part of the security clearance is that not only do you not have any connections to foreign countries and are in a maniac but you have to have a stable home life - well she started having an affair with a flight instructor now they were monitoring this on the phone and they knew it and I didn't so they stopped me coming in and their attitude at the time was we need to see how this is going to play out and if Lazar is gonna get a little weird or anything so let's just you know hold him off from coming in and you see what happens and they explain this to you what was happening well after the fact yeah cuz time kind of went on and there were guys that were following me around and I started getting a little concerned going well [ __ ] they booted me out of the project and if so they're not just gonna let me hang out at home and go get a new job knowing what I know so as time went on I started getting a little concerned and I took my closest friends and just kind of got together I said hey remember that job I told you about this is what's going on and like you don't need to take my word for it Wednesday night we need to all go out here I want to show you what's going on so I took everybody and we went out to remember since I had the test flight scheduled and went outside the base out into the desert and so everybody could see you know one of the high performance tests and you know it left quite an imprint on everybody so they knew I wasn't and there's videos of these tests right yeah but remember this isn't that it's in in the dark in the 80s of the big monster sized camcorder and you got you know a bright light jumping around but yeah I mean we did video of a but there's no by today's standards it's but it's your video specifically available the video that you took yeah well George Knapp has it it's is it an argument now do you I have no idea Jeremy yeah show clips of it in my film it's it's online and someone did a deep analysis of it it was interesting to take a look at how well this microphone up to face about a fish from your face right you know to see how his video looks now but as far as video evidence I mean we are talking 80s camp words the most important thing is the human story here everybody that he took up there on three separate occasions they don't all like each other they don't all talk they all agree on one thing they saw something that night at the exact point in time and space that Bob Lazar said and remember this is 1715 seventy miles south of area 51 no one even knew really about area 51 we're talking Papoose Lake and they all agree they saw something that night they had never seen before and they've ever seen sense right when he said it so that's one of like the six things where I'm like how did he know you can dismiss him I dismiss it but some things we can't get around and and there's about five or six of them how did he know about if Jamie wants to find that video right now what would you look under Bob Lazar UFO s for area 51 just kind of like that so it's like this s for UFO video bob lazar and god does an analysis but you're analyzing these 80's videos he from the very beginning Bob never said I have proof of my store and I'm going to tell the world he said at the very beginning I cannot prove my story that's not why I'm telling this George Knapp convinced him to tell people and he lived to it and I I didn't believe it either until I talked with George okay so you you filmed these this test flight one test flight and then you get caught actually it was I think the third time because we went out there the first time mmm everybody saw it everybody was amazed because it did some radical maneuvers and you know everybody had a lot to say but new vers that i've seen i've seen the video it doesn't I don't think there's something we have now that does that know in terms of like a human piloted craft I mean I don't know obviously with the governor it's impossible nothing can move like that and remember we didn't start filming from the very beginning you know at the core we were waiting for something you know to happen the craft took off and I came flying at a stopped you know turned it or I angle flew back and then you know after did some you know amazing stuff to get the camera and then we started filming so it doesn't have all of it on there just has some the way I describe it to my friends and they said what is I said take a laser pointer and then have a wall and then move it around the wall like you know how it moves around the wall it doesn't seem like it has anything to do with inertia or physics or it's not an impeded in any way by the atmosphere yeah that's what it looked at you're essentially separated from reality as crazy as that sounds with being in in case its own gravitational envelope inertia is not going to affect it and you know this is this is how some of those recent sightings would commander David flavor I'm sure you've heard of this exact you a UFO I mean he describes exactly that the thing operates exactly the way I was describing that's why he was interested to talk to me but we saw this and you know on the way home it's like way we got away with it we should try it again the next test flight day so this became a thing to do and I think it was on the third time that we got caught I mean we started becoming a little careless I think we took a Motorhome out there you know I mean it was like the stupidest thing you could possibly tell Gaytan yeah it was ridiculous and again you're in your 20s yeah and you know what was funny was we went out there and my friend Jean Huff and I were leaning on the front of a vehicle and just for some reason we just started talking jet like well I hope they realized that I don't remember what we were saying but you know that it's something about attacking the base or something along those lines and stealing the craft or something like that so I'm crazy and then about 20 feet in front of us we see a little green light fall on the ground and roll to us and unbeknownst to us now it's pitch black you can't see your hand in front of your face there are a bunch of guards standing right out there and they had a night-vision scope where they were like from here to the wall looking at us listening to us and the guy dropped it and the scope rolled over to us and you could see the green screen we turned the lights on and all these guys are there so it was whoa yeah yeah so we did incredibly stupid stuff and got caught as we should have because so when they catch you and they bring you in then what happens well I went in for debriefing the following day I went to Indian Springs Air Force Base which is kind of a defunct base that they used to use at the nuclear test site and this is when they brought out the transcript of the phone call with my wife and you know they sat me down and we said you know when we meant to keep the secret we meant you can't tell your friends right you know and it just being sarcastic and trying to mmm and then they got real serious but this is where they you know took the transcript out and we're reading me what my wife and you know our friend we're talking about and it was our dime so what happens from there what do they do with you why don't they arrest you I don't think I don't know I don't know why I'm not sure they exactly they knew what to do but they did let me go that night and I went home and that this is kind of when the most stressful part started because you're realizing you're being bombed yeah no yeah now I know not only am I being monitored but now I know I'm in trouble and it wasn't a short time after that that I contacted you know at that time the only investigative reporter I had heard of in Las Vegas was George Knapp and you know told him some of the story because I had no idea what the hell was gonna happen at that point so George Knapp tries to dissect your story tries to find holes in it tells it puts it online and makes everybody aware of it and that's how I found out about it yeah to make a long story short well what happens yet to really make a long story short what happens from there on I mean do they contact you and say hey Bob it's probably a good idea if you shut up how they try to label you as crazy was there there a boy there are a lot of things that happened at you know between that point I'm leaving out a lot of stuff to fill in the story we'd have to go back to Los Alamos and and well I really don't want to talk about that the top-secret weapons stuff that you were working on no I'm talking about the 115 um well I don't know I have to think about how what is the problem I don't want to get myself into more trouble by admitting something so I just have to dance around a couple great just during the filming of the movie piano but the movies great by the way thanks Jay and it's on Netflix right now if anyone who wants to check it out and if you're one of those people like me who you know I've always loved the idea of UFOs I became extremely weary talking to people who are UFO believers and UFO fanatics cuz there's so many of them they're full of [ __ ] and not just full of [ __ ] they're they're childishly delirious like the way they talk about things I mean there's so many people that are that I'm in contact they reach me in the night and they explained to me what we're doing to the ocean is wrong and like you know like okay this is one of the reasons I didn't want to do the show I'm sure it's no it's I mean it's no joke we've had people literally camp out on our front lawn and you know in some ways I can relate to some of these people you know maybe some of them did really have some kind of experience or saw something and if all their friends think they're crazy but hey now there's this guy I heard on the radio and Latinos I'm not full of [ __ ] so I got to talk to him and so most of the correspondents I get are people trying to get a hold of me come on Bob you you got to listen to me I'm I'm coming to talk to you I'm you know I'm driving from Oklahoma or whatever and and and but some of them are just [ __ ] batshit crazy I'm yeah they're frightening there's a lot of schizophrenic that are involved in the conspiracy world there's a lot of people that have real issues Joe I it would be a disservice to your audience to not say that we have to look at what's going on now and understand I've heard on your show a bunch of stuff about what's going on now and to not really understand what's going on now you can't see Bob's story in the correct light after 30 years and at some point we should just touch upon that the the biggest being that things like the tick tock UFO case that came out I've heard people even on the show say oh there's a glitch in the radar that's a data poor perspective you just don't know yet what's really going on commander flavor I was able to get the interview with him to talk with him way before it became public I I got that from him he saw it other pilots saw it this is a big thing that's going on right now they had more sightings on the East Coast recently cubes with with spherical or these are not aerodynamic and these are the people we trust to defend us on 9/11 commander favor protected Los Angeles on 9/11 so we trust them but they're not trained observers radar individuals see these things and the big the big one just to throw down so we can consider a story a little differently there's more depth to it the big one is the United States government has admitted that they have been continuously studying the UFO phenomenon that program was called a tip advanced eros or sorry was called AUSA that that's the mother program George Knapp got that out they announced through the New York Times about a tip but all set these acronyms awesome advanced aerospace weapon systems applications program who cares that was the mother program so they've admitted we didn't stop studying UFOs in 1969 with Project Blue Book we don't think it's crazy we're actually want to reverse engineer the technology that's why on your other show you said what's this AAV thing it's like they're making up another UFO name well hold on there's a reason because in the documents the DIA documents that George Knapp released that everybody said was faked till now they know is real they call them a AVS which is advanced aerospace vehicles people are getting acronyms wrong so they're the reason for the terminology change is so that we can mimic what we're reading in the DIA documents people can look for that now so they changed the names to get people away from UFO or UAP even like Hillary Clinton said on air right so what he's talking about Howard grunts I'm Hillary Clinton informed the public on Jimmy Kimmel Oh Jimmy we don't call them UFOs anymore we call them UA AP's unidentified aerial phenomenon right so she kind of was giving there the Clintons are very into the UFO topic Senator Reid you know he he's done a lot for the for the subject the study of it right so she informed the public so they could look for the right term so these terms are important because the dia in those documents they've been calling them a a vs for quite some time now and they changed the name to anomalous no that that's a miss no no so they always mess around with things but it's actually advanced right but they're describing it in the news they were calling an anomalous vehicle totally and that's cool they were also saying anomalous aerospace threats AAT right because they want the sense of a threat so my point is all of it if people don't know this now and they think this stuff is is fantasy this this part of it that we're studying it that we take it seriously we're spending money on it and that we're getting great data from from visual pilots to to radar that's why we know it's aerospace they dropped from 80,000 feet but guess what that's the top scope of the spy-1 radar is 80,000 feet so the radar system they were using it was coming from above that so my point is this if you don't understand that this is happening you're just behind the curve because you don't have the information because of the stigma that you're talking about I saw you get totally upset with UFO topic I met you first when you get totally upset with UFO topic it's the people when when you're doing your I'm sorry man when you're when you're doing your show you know the jargon questions everything I could see how how frustrating is trust me I have been frustrated too how luckily my mentors George Knapp and he's taught me the Pitts Paul pitfalls as I went through it my whole point in this rant right here is just that we have to now look at Bob's story but knowing the facts not someone saying it's a bird it's a plane it's a glitch they're not and so if you don't know that you just don't have the information yeah I'm not just that knowing the facts as we know him in 2019 not 1988 absolutely and so what is he said that has come true he's totally unimpressed with it right what does he said this come true so I was like Bob they've announced gravity as a wave you were right and you're vindicated and he looks at mean he's like well if you think about it Jeremy I had like a 50-50 chance he was not very impressed right when did they announce gravity as a wave so they detected in a sense they attempted gravity waves now who is they you might know more there's two black holes that were colliding and that's how they were able to detect yeah somebody bill I don't know which group it was or what part of the government that's what Google's fourth yeah what it but they you know built a gigantic gravity wave detector and pretty much detected that there are such things as first observation of gravitational waves it says it was in 2016 ok the first observation of gravitational waves was made on 14th of September 2015 rather as announced by the Li geo and Virgo collaborators on 11th of February 2016 previously gravitational waves had only been inferred indirectly via their effect on the timing of pulsars in binary star systems Danton Tom the wave form connected by both Li geo LIGO observatories master predictions of general relativity for gravity for a gravitational wave emanating from the inwards I'm trying to get this from the inward spiral and merger of a pair of black holes around 36 and 29 solar masses and the subsequent ring down of the single resulting black hole well that I mean yes no he was on in the 80s the predominant theory was gravity is produced by gravitons okay you know part of theoretical particles but they're not they're waves they're not particles and that's so the thought is that the way we experience gravity it's based on mass which is why the moon which is roughly one-quarter the size of the earth has 1/6 of the Earth's gravity so there's some sort of a computation you can make based on mass right and and remember we can observe the effects of gravity but we have no idea what it is all we can do is observe it and we can't make it the only way you can make gravity is just put more mass together it's just a product of gravity but if you can make a if you have a machine that makes gravity you can pretty much do anything you can affect time you can have force field all that stuff that's inside fiction becomes reality if you have a machine that can make gravity and what we worked on in the desert was a machine that makes gravity I love your analogy of dropping off a small nuclear reactor to the Victorian era I love that that analogy because back then that was impossible that was magic but you're talking about here the fact that they just discovered this four years ago that this is a wave but we're as much as we know and as impressed as we are as we should be with how much more technologically advanced we are than every other creature on this planet we're still in many ways in the adolescence of technological innovation absolutely absolutely if even adolescence and when you're talking about this binary star system Zeta Reticuli and who knows how much longer these things have been around than us who knows what their evolutionary cycles been who knows what I mean we might be talking about something that's a million years more advanced than us yeah yeah it could easily be now I'm not in believe it or not I'm not into UFOs I don't follow stories or you know even after your experiences no I'm fascinated with the technology and I it really it works me like every night I go to sleep that you know I don't that it was my own doing essentially that that prevented me from continuing on in the in the project I mean it's a that to be on that cutting edge of technology is so alluring to me right but you know by the same token I don't really care that there's aliens or where they come from I mean the prize is the technology and that's what I'm fascinated by but so I don't listen to UFO stories and that sort of thing but George Knapp is I mean he's the guy that has the contacts and tries to thread everything together and what he recently told me as he found I don't know is either documentation or people that he spoke to it's at this the existence of this project the project that I was on it's something that they seemed to take out every eight or ten years so that's a very specific memo and this is actually I this is the first time I'll be very clear with people about it it's a big topic of conversation right now it's called the Wilson memo you can look it up Admiral Wilson met with a scientist who's actually was featured in one of my films everybody has been debating whether or not this document of a conversation with a with an sitting Admiral at the time is a real document it's an actual conversation that happened and this document is right but he wants to know the world is going crazy right now in the UFO world I'll tell you straight up right now I'm in the position to know and it is a real document that it is real so the conversation you read in that that conversation was had I can't attest to every you're not being very clear sure please no problem so there was a document is circulating right now that is really big it's going around everywhere people are asking what is this document it's called the Wilson memo is what how you can find it online though or the Wilson leak there's Jimmy's got it the Wilson memorandum use of human vu Admiral Wilson meets with this scientist and they have this discussion oddly enough that special projects at EG&G and if I remember the document from 2001 I'm telling everybody right now it's real and we'll see my history is pretty good would like to say and if something is real or not right so here we go the document comes out they meet at EG&G special projects in 1989 they stumble into a problem this happens they put the technology away and then they bring it back out and see if the material science has caught up and if they can make any progress so this document kind of talks about this process the big thing I get from it and a lot of its vindicating to Bob and one of the things that's vindicating besides the EG&G thing is that private industry so this guy's an admiral and he says I found out about your essay P your special access program I need to know about it and he's going to a a private part of Industry and he is denied access and he says uh you know I should be running this program and they were able to deny him access so I think the takeaway here is get out I'm telling you that that is an actual correct that is a leak now everything said in that document and I don't know what are you talking about what what is said in that document it's it's a between a scientist and an admiral that are sitting and they're having a meeting and they're talking about the the search for the the UFO subject the search to get special access program access to all of these different things like reverse engineering programs so in this document they talk about it I believe that the this document that the person that went was employed by Robert Bigelow you know one of the guys has a couple of orbiting satellites and all that stuff he's a guy owned skinwalker ranch no he's not he was the guy okay yeah he used to own it there's a new owner and I interview him for my other film but there's a new owner and you'll be hearing a lot more about that soon but uh like it'll just there's their stuff that you'll be hearing about skinwalker ranch soon because there's a new owner anyway the whole point of this in you know insertion here is just that that document kind of validates a lot of this idea Bob just said that they make a little progress then they can't go anywhere they tuck it away and then they bring it back out you know ten years later and start working on it what is the limiting factor I think Bob should speak on this but it's the material science yeah it's really where physics is so I can I can see them doing that I mean I didn't have any information on that but I think what you know Georgia uncovered is probably accurate that you know we try and do what we can and once we reach a roadblock on we really can't figure it out it's just friggin wait put the thing away wait for science to catch up and you know a decade later let's take the project out again and see all right now where can we go but there's got to be someone who remains informed right oh yeah I've got your scientists like you and Barry you got you people that you compartmentalize you've got these people working there has to be some people right that know everything you've got security and then someone's gonna be on the outside saying hey we need people to guard this building don't let anybody in for 10 years I said yeah I think a lot of that is private industry and I think that's how they keep it yeah I think that's how they litter pick the government is just so leaky I think that's kind of what their dough is what the document kind of proves you just articulated that that it is in control private industry what private industry some aerospace company something I don't know yeah they wouldn't they would the guy would the Admiral wouldn't name it in the car in the conversation yeah so they still have these things supposedly I would guess I mean I don't have any information have you ever asked anyone that has any inkling of any idea of where they got them or how they got them no but something must have been said to me from Barry and but I Ike it was just too long ago and I I can't quite remember it was said but it it just left a seed in my mind I think at least one of them was part of an archeological dig so it's old something one at least one of them is old I don't know if it was the one I worked on but I remember something to do with an archaeological dig whoa so that's that means it's not just old it's ancient they'll be a great Steven Spielberg movie as all of it would yeah that came out when he said that for the first time no that's a freak out right yeah Harrods with some brushes looking for a Tyrannosaurus Rex bone hit metal and when did they find it you know that they have nine of them well and how could we have not heard about that what about the guys with the brushes how could you uncover something like that and with Joe's newspaper at home does I mean they said it on that first day oh you mean the Roswell yeah yeah I have a cover what is this is the document but I had to do some digging to find it yes it's just kind of yes so this is where they meet at EG&G and this is Admiral Wilson and there's a lot more coming out now I want to be clear George didn't put this out he didn't leak this out enemy this is I can tell you how I courted this this conversation so this was an employee of at the time Robert Bigelow and this is in 2002 right you remember when he had that government contract called hop the world all knows about now and he had knids it studied the ranch that 22 million everybody is saying it was for a tip advanced aerospace identification program the 22 million dollars was for all SAP that was pushed through through Congress three congressmen right an astronaut it was pushed through and that's what that 22 million dollars by the way they spend more money on viagra every year than they do studying UFOs if it was just this program which I think is funny more money from France they probably do them UFOs well you never know how it seeds in a population but anyway this program this is what was the mother program so it it got the 22 million and really it was to study skinwalker ranch oddly enough that 22 million all was inspired by the phenomenon they were seen at skinwalker ranch because the scientists they're seeing vehicles come through like a space in the sky yeah we went there I went yeah you interviewed a bunch of people that seemed full of [ __ ] but a couple didn't but this very very interesting totally and there's a bit in if you look I spent a lot of time in the area I'm not talking about those stories I'm saying there were scientists hired by the government right through Bigelow to study the ranch because they thought it was important and you know whatever whatever the point is that 22 million was to study that then we have a tip which is like an auxilary kind of program of military settings that commander flavors and that sort of thing this document is just one of those things that has now come forward that through the Bigelow studies it was government funded with and then it was personally funded and then government funded it's just one of those things that kind of shakes you because you got this military guy who can't get access because of the private industry that's holding these non-terrestrial materials that they can't study it so that's the the claim right now give it some time let people dig more into this it's fascinating man so you are essentially you're you're you're kicked out right you're you're out of the this program you can't work with these crafts anymore and do they give you any threats do they tell you what you have to do from here on out yeah well I mean the way it ended was I told George Knapp all this stuff and you know he said well let's just get it on tape should something happen at least we have a record of it and I don't remember what the impetus was but at some point George wanted to air it and he said you know you make the call on it and look if at any point you change your mind we won't air it and it came down to the day where George wants to put her on the five o'clock news he said this is important stuff people have to know about it and I thought it was too I said it's kind of a crime I know you got to keep the technology secret but you can't not tell everybody that this stuff is going on that we have you know actual hardware from another civilization it's a big [ __ ] deal you know probably the biggest one there ever was and George said you know today's the day we got to put it on the news or something to that effect and when it came right down to the time to air it I changed my mind and I said we're not doing it and that's what turned into the famous wrestling match between me and George trying to get the tape but he won because he was a bigger guy so you're actually physically wrestled well I think it was more of a pulling match we were I don't think we ever hit the ground but he got the tape put it in the player and boom five o'clock news was on and then I got a call after that and they said it was from Dennis he said you have any idea what we're gonna do to you now and he hung up the phone that was the last communication I had with him and what has happened to you since then after that a lot of people I've known either were audited by the IRS people had anybody I know that had clearances that worked in secure programs had the clearances pulled one of them friendly one of mine that Jeremy knows he's got on camera with me soon he'll tell the story now that he's out of work up there he was working up at the Tonopah test range waiting for his clearance to come through and you know they they pulled that it would it became it's like if they can't get the person that's involved they just create a problem for everybody that surrounds them and so I mean the way it turns out it hurt a lot of people's lives that I was connected to and that's an effective way of shutting someone up so you feel that by coming forward and going public that couldn't just snuff you out that was I mean that's what I was told and George and everybody you know said that you care no it's you know since it's public there's you know no one will touch you and I you know I I fell for it and I wish you didn't yeah sometimes sometimes when it's just over stress and people camp it on your lawn yeah but it's this is gonna make things worse doing this no does not make things better tell them how is this gonna make things better because you're getting a real chance to explain yourself in a way that's going to make people who are not only work in the government people that are police officers and firefighters and first responders and doctors and scientists they're going to emphasize emphasize empathize and and empathize with what it must be like to be a person like you in your 20s who gets thrust into this world unknowingly and confronted with one of the most if not the most important discovery in the history of human beings the big question are we alone it's the number one question there's two questions right what happens when we die and are we alone those are the two big questions right and if we're not alone and someone knows we're not alone and these some people who know we're not alone are these bungling sort of even if they weren't it's a crime yet they're not telling the rest of us but I mean I don't mean bungling in terms they're incompetent I mean they can't be competent it seems to me to what you're describing that no one can be competent with this technology like the victory Victorian era scholars analyzing some sort of a nuclear reactor there's there's no way why do you think why do you think they're not telling us let's just make assumption that this is true right now why do you think that they're not telling us that our government doesn't tell us what's your best well let me put it in the it would you do if I'm the president okay and I get this information what do I do with this what do I do this there's something that we don't know there's something we don't understand there's something that came from another world we got it tucked away in the mountains and I just want you guys to know about it hey sleep tight hey American Idol is on tonight who you thinks gonna win yeah who's gonna win another one is uncertainty and the other one is what Bob and I've talked about a lot absolutely not knowing what to tell people because you don't really understand it yourself even right God what do you say you if you want to run a government you want to get people to pay their tax and there's something else yeah you says you have these objects fine with impunity right and yes someone else well not only that what can you say like how much do you really know I think it's mainly the tech knowledge that they just want to keep the technology secret because there's yeah whoever gets this yeah you you control the where you become you literally become invincible once you master the technology you can't you cannot penetrate a field like that so I imagine that's I know it's all science fiction but science fiction turns into science fact if you have real force fields around aircraft in battleships you you win you win you can force your will upon anybody and like I said there's so much more to the story when I was first there there were Russian scientists at s4 that was this was early on in the project this was before Operation Paperclip became public as well right I would imagine that was I don't know what the dates when was it when did that was 98 I think yeah yeah I don't know the dates on roughly ten years later Operation Paperclip becomes Freedom of Information Act we say that Russia and that Germany he's have a Russian scientists yeah but I mean Russian scientists a lot of them came from Germany a lot of those those rocket scientists that work with NASA they all came from Nazi scientists got it so some Russians got some of them I just know at some point there was intense cooperation with Raymond even exchanging some ideas on nuclear weapons and you know EMP tests and some things we would never have discussed with them but at the same time it was in the late 80s they were involved actually in the area at s4 with us and guts communicate with these guys are you solving no I knew they were there berry berry would talk about the commies that were there the counties and that was back when they were the Commons yes there were real commies and at some point it wasn't our group but at some point there was a big discovery made and this did not happen when I was there it happened in between my trips to there and after that apparently they decided it was just too cool to share with anybody and the Russians were never allowed back on the base after that but you don't know what that discovery was no no I said it wasn't my group so one of the other groups really found out something but the you know in typical American fashion is all right this as our as you guys get the hell out here was there any inkling that any other government had something similar no no nothing that I had her see that was the thing that always freaked me out was why if if something was so superior to human beings it's almost like visiting an ant colony like why would you go to the Queen I don't give a [ __ ] who the queen is I'm a human I'm so superior to you ants I don't care who you have running your hive I'm just gonna study it I think it's who got it who got it look at the you know rocket technology in Germany but they got nine of them yeah that doesn't make sense to me either so they were either in the same area or you know one had clues to where others were I mean I don't know you you have to fill that in there but you're right I mean nine of them that's a that that's a a big dig if it was archeological well one of the more recent the recent sightings and these discussions that have been coming out recently from Air Force pilots and Navy pilots they've been talking about things happening in the ocean and that that something go literally goes into the water or something maybe below the surface think about water 2004 tick-tack Nimitz case so that's when George Knapp and I broke on the radio twice before the New York Times said no this one really well commander favor and those pilots there was a disturbance on the surface of the water commander flavor visually saw what looked like similar to across some object so it's like as if you have some a coral under the water and you've got it's breaking over right the tic-tac is doing this crazy maneuver that defies it's a gravity propelled says they saw it in the sky before they saw in the water right yeah so there were there were radar that was picking this these things coming down from 80,000 feet drop into 50 feet in less than a second this is it this is actually on the news today there was a briefing so a lot of people get this confused I did not this one none either no so that is called the gimbal so there's three videos released by the Pentagon that are all after shoe light and keep the volume on fire I would I would really just pay attention to the source video so you've got the tic-tac which is this object the commander flavor saw another pilot filmed it with a FLIR pod and it goes to but this one you see is really important to Bob's story the gimbal craft it's been recently analyzed it's FLIR not only does it its definitive that it's not conventional anything by the by its movements but there's a pocket of cold air around a propulsion source so this object by the way sat stationary for days if not weeks it's at stationary you know they found it 11 hours later and they were saying there's no way this thing using that kind of energy to go that fast could just hover the amount of time and by the way you're seeing a very small part of what happened that day this object was not alone and so hopefully that information comes out and we can I mean I wish we had video of it I'm sure we'd all want to see it but that's called the gimbal that was East Coast right 2015 West Coast 2004 was the tick-tack the disturbance on the water commander flavor believes there was something under that water that was causing that disturbance when the tic-tock was coming around to do in it with inside the the people that are studying this they're thinking maybe the tic-tac system was causing the disturbance but the USO unidentified submerged object that he visually saw the whole interesting thing about that is I would love Bob to describe it is why it doesn't matter if these craft are in space air or water why doesn't it matter I love when he talks about this [ __ ] well first of all commander flavor was the f-18 pilot off the Nimitz that was sent out to find out what this stuff is but and it wasn't just I got a chance to talk to him recently and it wasn't just a radar image I mean commander flavor had eyes on it for over five minutes watching this thing as four other pilots did so this wasn't a radar blip or anything I mean these guys were watching this thing but you know one of the things I think in the gimbal video the way the craft that we worked on flies is it doesn't fly like conventional aircraft does and it doesn't fly like a flying saucer Witter in a 1950s movie it flies belly-first I mean it may set down conventionally but it always rotates it doesn't roll maneuver puts its belly towards the target and then moves your car flying with the wheels forward right right I mean it may lift it land on the wheels but at some point when it wants to leave the flips up points the wheels where it wants to go and takes off and the gimbal video you can see the craft do the roll maneuver and it's really interesting it behaves exactly like the craft that I worked on so much like we have different shaped aircrafts and fighter jets and cars they probably have different shapes of these objects that operate under similar principles right but they all have the same power source all the same power source and we're also dealing with if you think about the laws of technological progression you know you think of Moore's law and you think of how things accelerate you've got to think that if this civilization is who knows how many years more advanced than we are if not even years I mean I mean we're thinking about in terms of conventional terms right the way the way we look at the world I mean they may be they might be just superior in terms of their intellect they've gotta be maybe maybe we don't know well the only reason I I say that is because look everyone doesn't necessarily start at steam engine right and go to an internal combustion engine and then you know electric power nuclear power and go up the ladder that we right can't weigh on you know the binary if the stuff is true about the origin and the binary star system and they have heavier elements that we don't have and this element stable element 115 is a naturally occurring material maybe that's the first thing they started experimenting with and the version of their steam engine their first product was something that operated like this and actually when they came to earth to look around or you know whatever they were amazed at the stuff we were doing these guys burned stuff and squirted out the back to go forward so right um right you know who says they follow any kind of normal progression like that my thought was if you went back to the 1400s and then you went from 1400 to 1500 you're not gonna see that much of a difference technologically right if you go from 2,000 to 3,000 I assume there's going to be a radical change right well they yeah the Delta the rate of change is is magnificently higher than it used to be right so if you think about what they had in 1988 and you think about what they probably have in 2019 just logically seems like they would advance I would think so the only question is like are they living is that a living thing in terms of like a biological thing or are they some sort of an artificially created creation like we are working on right now I mean we're in the middle of working on artificial reality artificial being sentient beings artificial intelligence there's constant there's silicon-based life forms that they're essentially trying to create Boston dinette was it Boston Dynamics of the company's robot robots yeah you can make machines out of flesh right so a cyborg or cybernetic organism is just that you know that's what a lot of people think those like gray things or you know that people call the greys you know it's like they were like their machines rented from flesh so what you're saying is like just no synthetic like they don't even need to be you know machines well they seem to have no sex organs where they're described by people that have had interactions with them assume these people aren't lying right or crazy or whatever right that they have no sex organs and that they don't seem to have any muscle there's almost like a frame right and they have enormous heads I mean if you look at Australia Pittacus or depictions of you know ancient hominids and then you go to human beings one of the things you see is bigger heads and weaker bodies well you see some clear progression of evolution you know where or something like that I would lean towards synthetic organism because it looks like it was made for a specific task there's no reproductive organs so I mean that almost kind of leaves out any kind of you know physical evolution right well that's also the bottleneck right our bottleneck is our biological imperative the the need to breed emotions fear anxiety all these different things that exist in order to force us into making sure we reproduce I mean that's essentially there's a human reward systems that aren't necessary once they can figure out a way to make some sort of sentient artificial life some sort of thing that doesn't have these biological limitations that we have by the way these crafts all these different kinds have been reported because it was confusing I always thought of flying saucers what I heard Bob Lazar talk about Flying Saucer right but if you look back in history people have always reported the weirdest shapes like none of them are alike you know there there are other saucers but you got cigar shaped you got you know the top hatching you have orbs why maybe they're serving different purposes they're doing different things like we'd use different tools and I want to be clear the reason I know that memo is is real is because I spend a lot of time with dr. Edgar Mitchell a six man to walk on the moon last guy to film before he died right that's how I know I don't want any journalists thinking I got it from anywhere else I know because of dr. Mitchell and he said the same thing maybe these things are performing different tasks you know and that's what I seen if you if you think about what an alien is in terms of our are the sort of iconic image of an alien like the Steven Spielberg Close Encounters of the third time the Third Kind alien they seem like what we'd assume a human being would eventually become right and if these things are tied human beings are smaller than they've ever been before the weaker than they've ever been before and there seems to be a trend in that direction and this trend seems to be amplified by our technological progression there are a lack of need for muscle strength and our lack of need for violence and we're moving in a society to try to get away from all the things that we think or a bore and about human beings and the terrible behaviors that we have if we one day do give birth to some sort of an artificial being like Marshall McLuhan's quote we are the sex organs of the Machine world you know that one day we all buy this yeah McLuhan was brilliant and that that quote has always been one of my favorites because okay what are we doing when we were constantly technologically innovating we're constantly looking for faster cars better computers bigger screens faster more resolution more pixels more this more that higher bandwidth five G 10 G right what are we doing we're moving into this in this if you just follow it objectively stay stand back don't attach yourself or your civilization your culture to it and look at what it is we're moving a hundred percent towards technological innovation if you looked at this species from afar and if you weren't a part of it you would say what does this species do oh they make things they make things better every year beehives the same [ __ ] thing that you see ten years ago you go by see a bee hi it's amazing it's cool but they're the same [ __ ] thing they figured out how to do it they make a beehive right we don't do that we make better things what would you constantly and at some point I think that technology is gonna fuse with us yes and we're gonna because already happening yeah Yvan must talked about it on my podcast that we are cyborgs you just carry it in your pocket it's a phone it answers any question you want you couldn't talk to it it'll give you the answers into the answers instantaneously it navigates you it has all your phone numbers in it has all your contacts you can get a hold of people people listening to you through it it's connecting us in ways even involuntarily haptics that kind of yeah it's also getting on your wrist how many people have I watches Apple watch is it all right the rest right and that's only because we can't integrate them yet but if you know that point it's kind of percent yeah I didn't joke about it last night but I have a bit about it that I do about the integration between humans and technology what would you do if you are a hyper intelligence right would you do the work yourself or would you create some cool things called like humans to do it for you would you create things that are cybernetic organisms to come in with machines and do it for you if you're a hyper intelligence that has kind of changed like you've described you'd probably create workers right well that's a vast conspiracy theory I'm not talking about conspiracy but it is a kind of a conspiracy I'm asking you well I mean I don't think it's necessarily that I mean you could look at it that way but that is the way a conspiracy theorist would look at it the way I would look at it is like there's obviously a progression going on a biological progression there's some sort of an integration with technology there's some sort of imperative this need for technological innovation it's inescapable everyone has it and I think it's attached to materialism and some sort of a strange way because so many people work so hard to get new things and like God that seems so illogical and preposterous and it makes people unhappy and depressions on the rise but nobody seems to be able to stop it like why is that well maybe it's because we are the electronic caterpillars that give birth to the butterfly maybe that's what we're doing very well but our job is to do is to make some sort of a cocoon and we don't even know we're doing it while we're doing it do you think a caterpillar as well hey caterpillar what are you doing man just doing my thing it's my job I have to make this could be a natural part of evolution it could be that right just supposed to do this and make the jump to some sort of mechanized right yeah an orangutan that is fishing with a spear no they've figured out how to fish with Spears there's there's some primatologist without somebody showing them how to fish no they've imitated human beings doing it and now they do it but they do it independently they're not trained orangutans they're wild rank believe that there's a wild ratts impressive well there's these primatologist I guess you would call them primatologist that's a term that's a great biologist biologists that believe that monkeys and chimps and some of the great apes are moving into the Stone Age that they've currently entered the Stone Age like they're not staying what they were a hundred thousand years ago or five hundred thousand years ago but they're actively using tools and they're experimenting with different different ways to use those tools and then they're making tools out of stone they're making these tools out of sticks and they're using them well this might just be what happens this might just be what happens I mean why else why would why the [ __ ] we work so hard I mean I was I was driving to LA this morning I had a doctor's appointment so I was on the 405 at 8:00 in the morning but Jesus Christ like this is so crazy when you're in the 405 in LA at 8 o'clock in the morning you see literally a million cars and it's just everywhere you go it's people but and also I'm in a Tesla so I have it on autopilot so I'm there sitting I'm listening to a podcast I barely have my hand on the wheel I'm not touching [ __ ] this cars driving me along I'm not even doing anything I'm just I'm just hanging out it's so much less stress do it that way right so it encourages you to innovate it encourages you to embrace this new technology I got this giant screen it's showing me the navigation in front of me Oh be there five minutes early excellent and I'm listening to a podcast wirelessly it's Bluetooth screen streaming from my phone and I pulled that podcast which came out today out of the [ __ ] sky and I'm listening to it and I'm all comfortable in my nice little car just driving on my way to the doctor's office this is irresistible stuff yeah yeah it's frightening ly irresistible but is it frightening I mean if you were a monkey or if you were an Australia Pittacus would you go man I don't want to [ __ ] be a person I live in a house that's [ __ ] I like just swinging around on trees I like running from Jaguars this is life guys life is running from crocodiles it's not living in the [ __ ] suburban oh there's probably some letter like that yeah I don't think so I think I think what when it comes we're gonna embrace it we're gonna embrace it the same way embrace cellphones the same way embrace television there's gonna be a few holdouts I don't even know an email address man those although there's a few and far between there good luck with that [ __ ] go move to the woods Ted Kaczynski yeah I was just gonna throw Ted Kaczynski was right this is something that I think about sometimes when I get really that Ted Kaczynski was a part of the Harvard LSD studies this has been proven Ted Kaczynski they cooked his [ __ ] brain when he was at Harvard and then when he went over to Berkeley and became a professor his goal was to make enough money so that he could to implement this program and live in the woods and then write his manifesto and start killing people that were involved in propagating technology he was expunged from the Harvard logs by the way this is something my friend just called me about so there's like this private library and they used to print people's names whenever they were part of a university and he was one of the handful of people that were expunged from it I want to jump back to the one thing Joe I don't want to be very careful with that word conspiracy theorist what I was what I was saying to you was we terraform our earth right we tariffs when we change the environment we do all this innovation what is stopping us from thinking that that's not being done I'm not saying it is I'm saying what's stopping us from thinking that that's being done on a much bigger level on a cosmic level you mean like aliens coming down doing that to humans so I'm telling you that there is something here that's there's a fact you know there's something there are craft they're here they're not ours they're here so the question is what is that about and I'm just looking at what we do with what you're describing with technology I think it's much more likely that the same way we observe chimps and we observe that they are now in the Stone Age that they're observing us and that they're recognizing that there is a pattern that there is a there's a steps that happened I mean Carl Sagan talked about the different levels of civilization and then you know if we don't get past certain levels we're never going to reach this I mean we're in civilization gonna stay type zero well we're in this warring polluting yeah pillaging were awesome civilizations well we're awesome in a lot of ways you know but in that way we're not well yeah where were children that have immense power that we didn't really the other thing is you're using the immense power that other people have created right I mean even when you're driving a car you stomp it on the gas like whoo you didn't invent the [ __ ] engine you didn't invent tires there's all these things that were involved in the creation of this thing that is really outside of your grasp of understanding but yet you have the ability to use it like a person with a gun I'm just gonna bang bang bang people you don't you didn't invent a gun so like you've you've without the intellect to craft and engineer and in and manifest these creations you just have access to them because you have paper or your Bitcoin or whatever the [ __ ] you're using using a credit card now you have almost no responsibility you just you could just flippantly use these things which is why we you know we were very childlike in our actions because we haven't had to earn the responsibility we haven't had to earn these things that we've been able to have and you've only been able to have them because other people have innovated and spent ungodly amounts of time and effort and focus in the lab to create these things and then they've all put them together and then what is the what's the reason to put them together to profit well what's the reason to profit well why are you doing this so you can buy more things well what are we doing what are we doing we're making better things that's what we do that's all that's all we do is make better yeah why the [ __ ] do we need oil why do we need oil why can't we just burn wood and stay home why can't we grow chickens and food in the backyard why can't we do what we [ __ ] can we certainly can people do do it but we decide to make that almost impossible our preferred way of living is to stuff everyone into a very small area where no one grows anything other than weed this is what la is la is 20 million people with hard surfaces ISM is many hard surfaces you can boy if you got an acre backyard now a holy [ __ ] look at all that grain this is amazing no that's the [ __ ] earth coming through this weird sort of creation that we've put on top of the earth but the goal is that like New York City that's there's none of it right you just got you've got Central Park and they just got human [ __ ] you've stacked up no one's growing anything and then constant work everyone's up early go go go innovate progress make that money so you can buy more things and every year hey Apple where's this [ __ ] new phone as if your phone isn't good around yeah phone's taking pictures and videos and people are calling you when you got applications to tell you which way the winds blowing it's not gonna blink of an eye blink of an eye it's all gone though that you know like ten thousand years and the Hoover Dam goes or whatever you know Mount Rushmore disintegrates so it's amazing because we have created that and and everything's trying to spring up through that we keep it maintenance down but we're we're a blink man something hits but we don't think that way well you know you think in terms of your own life right you think in terms of what you want and what you need right now you know what it's we are in many ways this combination of this weird primitive ape-like thing with the ability to calculate and manipulate our world in our environment that makes us holy unique on top of that with existential angst and and and fear so what do you do with that with [ __ ] water down with the pre antidepressants give these [ __ ] people some [ __ ] that keeps them moving well they're worried about the future they're trying to figure out what reality is it's just you're on a goddamn convertible spaceship spending a thousand miles an hour hurling through infinity there's no meaning to this thing just keep making [ __ ] keep making stuff and then one day they're gonna be able to hit that switch and this life will be born out of innovation and thinking and progress and technology and more than likely it's probably going to be what we're seeing that these things are that you're you're observing mm-hmm I'm not observing them but yeah some ones are you implying that they're us I don't think they are us but I think they are what happens when things keep going it's not us just like we're not monkeys right all right I'm not a chimp oh that's a cool like they're from here is your idea no no no that this is what happens all over the union right yeah this is what happened here's the thing you know I went to see Brian Cox's he has this amazing live show with Robin ence where they have these LED screens he's huge screens with high resolution depictions of the cosmos and one of the most mind-blowing things was he has this large-scale image of the universe and it shows all the individual galaxies of the universe and it just keeps moving through all these galaxies in three dimensions and it's [ __ ] incredible but what's stunning is the relative uniformity of it even at you know I mean you're obviously looking at an incredibly small depiction of something that's immensely large like a galaxy of hundreds of billions of stars you're seeing it as this little dot but this little dot that's flying through space surrounded by other little darts with very similarly spaced distances yeah Himanshu yeah so Mike if we see uniformity in that form in terms of like the distance between cows like so many galaxies is so it's so similar they might vary slightly and that slightly might be hundreds of millions of light years right but but but there's so much uniformity why would we not assume that that uniformity exists pretty much everywhere and that all these things that you're seeing that are so similar you do see binary star systems you do see single star systems like sorry but there's also some some speculation that earth and that our solar system was one time was a binary star system right I mean that's one of the the speculations about that that object that they find outside the Kuiper belt that the thing is ten times larger than Earth they think it might have been at one point in time a star but this this uniformity that you see why wouldn't we think that that that has it's same implications biologically that there's some sort of a biological uniformity and that this happens given the right sets of circumstances yeah you should be you should tell them some of the stuff that you've read that you don't know is true I mean if the the stuff was true about the propulsion stuff I mean anyway he well what have you read what what you saw - um you know what are you talking about spill the beans Bob I got to poke the bear here get some more liquor in yeah the well I mean the again the the only thing I could verify was what I had my hands on they were you know there was talk of weapon systems that there were different projects project Galileo project sidekick was supposed to be weapon applications of the craft project Looking Glass had to do with time any effects of time in the craft now I don't think we're not talking about making a time machine like in science but we're talking about you know small distortions intentional distortions of time and how that can be used you know as a not as a well it was part of a weapon Pro how are you informed in this phase again where there's just the small briefings that I read but again I don't really like to talk about those because I don't have any information on him and it was just you know small briefings he told commander flavor that what he saw might have been a time dilation and not because gravity affects time you know space time I'm sure you've heard of that and you know what what commander Faber saw as he was in the f-18 approaching it he said it he described it as a ping-pong ball in a cup and shaking it back and forth it was moving that fast now obviously if there's anything inside there it's gonna be battered to hell but you know my point was was that well one of two things either there's a gravitational envelope in there which negates any inertia effects or you are seeing through a gravity distortion field so you know just like you're looking at a a hot Highway and you see you know an optical distortion going through there well the same thing happens in gravity and the craft may not actually be moving like that it may just look like it because you're seeing you can only see it through the field so it may be making much more gentle moves I'm not saying that's it but it has to be one of the two and the thing shows up 60 miles away they noticed it on radar 60 seconds after left commander flavor but it was at his cap point which is the next point he was destined to go 260 miles away and in 60 seconds on radar the same object ends up there so it's going a mile a second no they I think the radar just picked it up in 60 seconds yeah it could have been there instantly but yeah we don't know the psychics time nobody knows that's whole thing also its cycles like radar cycles min doesn't sweep a planar array so it just you know scans around it it random place the spy-1 does the really cool present do the whole loop anymore right the point uh the point is though that the craft moved to his next location before he knew where his next location was going to be Jesus and that I mean that's well documented so that that's a pretty shocking piece of information what's fascinating to me too is that you were discussing this the the way this reactor worked and that these things were not really connected no nothing is connected there's no wiring at all that freaks me the [ __ ] out charge your iPhone you know yeah yeah yeah I mean that's the that's yeah I know again but that's just simple electromagnetic induction revenue Tesla the scientist had this concept of right yeah yeah that's what I'm talking mean Franklin on the worse and he wanted to send wireless electricity through the sky and Westinghouse was like get the [ __ ] out of here with that like when anybody could just pull electricity yeah this cab meter yeah they couldn't we just talk in the car right over trying to chill them out you know we're talking about Tesla you know you couldn't be meter didn't how it all that down so that's funny bring it up yeah that don't mean who knows what would have happened in terms of innovation had he been allowed to go forward with that well we probably wouldn't have computers you think yeah I'm pretty positive well I mean forget about micro electronics well this is dumping huge amounts of electromagnetic energy in the air and yeah we'd be able to wirelessly turn on our lights but there'd be no radio communication the interference would be something we could would be overwhelming it would induce electric currents and anything with a small wire on it so integrated circuits transistors would be disintegrated before they were even you know tested for operation so it would it ways elect us up yeah it would have stopped us dead we'd have it'd be great you can turn lighters on and heaters from all over the place with no wires but it would stop modern electronics and this we became dependent on it it would almost be like our dependence on fossil fuels although its destructive it's very difficult for us to get off the nipple it would have changed the course of how he developed which is so interesting when you talk about it a civilization of the star system didn't even start with fossil fuels they had 115 naturally on their planet and they're like cool anti-gravity is pretty awesome well the fact that they I think it's important that that actually happened yeah it might have been stopped in its tracks for a reason whoa and it's just it's I think it's incredibly difficult for us to imagine technological progression under another timeline other than one that we've experienced yeah that's difficult if we imagine what this alien race must have been like and uh I mean God just just to be able to see something to like I mean obviously we've seen it in different life forms right like we see the life of certain beetles in comparison to the life of certain fish very very different existence very different life cycles octopus yeah octopus I mean we see all these different variables in terms of biological entities on earth but we don't see it in terms of technological innovation as we're the only one that's intelligent that can innovate we we have intelligent creatures but they're in the ocean the only other thing that are like us are dolphins and orcas and whales and they don't have the ability to manipulate their environment and subsequently because they don't have the ability to emit and manipulate their environment we put them in fish tanks and we're like get in the tank do some tricks right you know the only thing he saw in the craft if we were considering Bob's story the only thing that you he saw in the craft that he related to it looked like a human could make was this honeycomb hatch and I always loved that because you're like obsessed with this thing that you could recognize a focus on that because it was the one thing that I understood how it worked what was it and it was it was the access to the level below and it was well you know if you take yep a six-pack of beer and you take out the cardboard dividers mm-hmm set it on the table you can put a lot of pressure on the top but if you push it from the sides it collapses flat mmm so it was something like that in a honeycomb shape that was essentially some sort of sheet metal and you could walk on that an upper layer but if you took the corner stuck your finger in and pushed it collapsed and made a an entryway hmm so I thought that was a really unique I had never seen that before and it was the only thing in the crap that made absolute sense to me as it ah we can make that and all that is as a hatchway was there any discussion about the materials that were used to make the craft I'm sure there was but that was a metallurgy division had nothing to do with us she never got a not even the slightest briefing I don't even know if it was metal or it was ceramic it's I think it there's a fine line between the two now one of the things that's happened to you that has allowed people to discredit you was there's obviously been some sort of an effort to erase your past yeah some sort of an effort to erase your education history your employment history at los alamos in fact the only way your employment history was proven at los alamos if someone got a list a directory of the employees from the past and read into it and you were on that list so it proved that you worked there even though people were trying to deny and they were trying to use that as a way to discredit you never did work at los alamos you weren't real scientists what was what was that like to experience I mean of course we're talking about the 1980's the 1990s when you could get away with something like that yeah I always say there are a lot less a lot less records on computers at that time it was still file cabinets and folders but yeah that was frightening that was one of the first things I think it's I think George Knapp was the first one that uncovered that I mean he saw my birth certificate disappear he disappeared yeah there was no record of you being there was there was no record of that there was money his mom tells me about that like it was frightening for her for he's got a real family you know he's real person is frightening for her but if the Los Alamos thing really surprised me and that there was so adamant that now this guy never worked here don't be ridiculous and George went back and forth you know for I got the letters on the world yeah once I mean it was ridiculous but fortunately somebody came up with a 1982 phone book directory I mean and also originally I told you you know when I worked there I was on the front page of the paper so they were still able to archive you know break bring that back from the archives and you know Bob Lazar a physicist working here at Los Alamos oh there was at least something there but somehow George came up with the phone directory and then George then Bob took George with cameras into Los Alamos oh yeah yeah so we flew out there and I said look come on in I'll show you where I worked we'll go in well meet people and George went with me and you know no gate the place oh yeah you know met people and you know and Los Alamos was also the place where they had the machine that was able to read the the size of your digits no no that was awesome that was s4 that was s4 and explain that so now this was back in the 80s and this is back in the 80s where when you discuss this people like this doesn't even exist yeah okay what was it it was a way you know this is before fingerprint scanners and you know and anything of anything a high-resolution scanner at that time so what it was was a device that had a little picture of a hand on a glass plate with pins in it so you could Jam your hand in there and there was a bright light above it and a sensor underneath and when you put your hand in there the light would turn on and it would measure the bones in your finger because the light shone through your bones and apparently the length of the bones and your fingers are extremely unique and easy to measure and they use that when you put your hands on there the light would turn on and your badge would pop out there's it oh there it is that's that's it and I tried to describe this to people and they said that is the most ridiculous thing we've ever heard and I said hey that my badge came out of that thing I put my hand on it badge popped out and that's how I could open the doors and get into s4 and you know and everybody discredited that they said it was [ __ ] it was thought of science fiction and Jeremy you found that I found it through a good friend of mine named Tyler rogue away and he had some good sources inside of area 52 where they also used these for the stealth program right around that time so now I've got all these people that worked within who you know said only if you're in certain programs would we use this technology it's kind of [ __ ] actually they didn't keep it for very long beginning of biometrics so I was able to reveal it in my film I kept my mouth shut until I showed it to Bob you know the movie is the first time he saw it was how you see in the documentary that's his genuine reaction getting goosebumps that was a great idea the way you did it thank you man because you know what guess what I'm actually trying to see if he's telling the truth that's how I started you know that I started so it was really cool to see that that you get to see it his no actual reaction has that been verified by other people yeah so yes so to me it has personally I get emails every day and people are telling me where these are used and how they're used and the send me photos I got a lot of photos by Danny Matteson and how they were used right they're not how they were you invite using yeah but I don't the most recent one was way more recent than I thought in another country but yeah that technology was used so what's so funny is that this technology even in the area of 52 where they'd use them for Tonopah one of the guys who will go on camera when he will do an interview with me he was a technician for one of these and and he hated them cuz they were really bad they always broke down and never and he was a technician for him and he won't tell me where if he worked at area 52 so is probably Tonopah it's very separated even on base but yeah so there was that yeah there is your education record that was also like what happened with that that well that disappeared also you know that I I have I've never gone I've never gone anywhere for education I've never gone I never attended any classes at Cal Tech I never attended anything at MIT you did attend classes in those places I did attend classes in those places do you know anybody that you went to school with yes I do and have they verified that they went to school with you well I give Jeremy some names but people yeah I the reason I don't say these names publicly is every single time I mentioned a name somebody gets and you don't want to be yours yeah yeah of course but what what is that experience like seeing your birth certificate erased seeing your employment is frightening it's it's absolutely fright it's also the fuel that the debunkers use the so called air quotes skeptics I don't like the term skeptics I want to say this probably because I really only said this privately I think it's a sloppy lazy way to look at things to just be a skeptic let's be objective and I think there's a lot of things you should be skeptical of I think you should you should look at things and look at things from a hard-line science perspective but the idea of skeptics the problem with that is you're always looking for things to be [ __ ] yeah and I think that's dangerous because I think some things aren't [ __ ] it's confirmation bias on the other end you did is I need to take a square thing and put it in a round hole no matter what and I find a lot of them to be lazy a lot of them to be lazy thinkers sure because they're always putting it into that box instead of going hmm instead of just separating their ego they're trying they're playing a game and the game is calling [ __ ] I want to call [ __ ] and I'm gonna line up all these reasons why it's [ __ ] and I'm gonna ignore anything that might be contrary to that definition yeah that does every time I'm thinking I'm gonna catch him in something you know all along this process um I found dr. Crangle he came forward and said I was in security briefings with Bob Lazar the physicist at Los Alamos he went on the record with me now the other people I talked with well I won't they go on the record with me because they're still working there so that that's the difference right what is that what can the public have well or even if they're not working there that you know they want to live their lives I mean obviously people have seen what's happened to you Mike Thigpen after 30 years yeah really if you look at all the information on you know concerning my accounts that's that's verifiable it can't possibly be a [ __ ] story anymore it's really way past that point yeah I mean that was my big pen is I mean how is that he was assistant lino so Mike Thigpen was the that did the security clearances to go to the bait one of the guys that was a guy that you work with he said he did right and and George Knapp you know George didn't believe him George put him through four polygraph tests right he tried to see man this is a big risk it sounds interesting but let's see if he's telling the truth one of the things was Bob said there's a guy named Ike Thigpen he did security clearances for the base and that's a weird name it's a very specific for 30 years George found this guy in this weird department that he didn't even know it was my dig pin the guy wouldn't talk to me ghosts and I'm totally goes in for 30 years used Facebook and Google image match through his children I was able to find him after 30 years and I talked him three times on the phone he lives on the East Coast he almost went on camera with me confirmed that he did security clearances for the base in 1989 confirmed he remembers Bob Lazar and what you don't know is there's a handwritten note that a friend of yours has from Mike what I'd um I'll give it to you later I don't but that is real that is actual so handwritten oh this is what you know this isn't it so when the I when you're when they do security Clanton clearances they go through all your friends and yeah yeah so this is to Bob and I had people come to me for a friend of mine that's serving and they were doing a security clearance for him and even though I'm like the UFO guy they did you know the FBI come and visit my house and make sure that they talk about my friend and they lift a little card and when my wife told me to get away because he didn't know who they were they left a little card it's super cute now back then it was a handwritten note and his friend has it for him that you haven't seen and oh my god two decades so if you're listening what is this card it's just a little handwritten note with Mike Thigpen signature card like a like a like a postcard like a piece of paper that he left on the door saying when Bob gets back or whatever it says on it so it's just another little funny thing I found the guy he does the security clearances he admitted to me he did it and he admitted to me he was dodging George Knapp because when George said his name on the written on the on the news he dropped his fork into his steak into his potatoes or whatever and he's looking at his wife he was in trouble his name's never supposed to be out they're like there's just a security clearance guy but you don't want national attention associated with anything bob has to say but anyway this unique name Bob said for 30 years and the guy goes to George Knapp George could prove he existed he actually talked to me man he talked to me three times he almost went on camera with me it's just crazy what what do you what happens after 30 years you just get more info well that's one of the reasons why when you and me and Jeremy and George Knapp had that conversation on the phone yeah I said I think what we can do with this podcast is important I really do I think it's important for people to hear this from you in a very clear just very concise way and if you examine all the information that you've said today if you you look at all the things that the detractors have said if you look at all of the new recent evidence that's coming out and all these really high-level people in the military and the government that are discussing this it gives you far more credibility then you would have had in the nineteen when this came out look yes you can't ignore his don't worry just because you don't like it anymore that's why I thought it was important that you come out and refresh the world's memory and let people know and like I said I've been and I say I'm a fan of yours but I guess I'm a fan of yours as a human being of a fan of yours but I've been following you for decades I've been following the story for decades I mean I'm kidding I have V Chester Bob like a lot of the world has yeah it's crazy well anybody that has any sort of a vested interest or just a even a just a fascination with UFOs has followed your story because there's no one else there's no one else that comes for this some guy have said I worked underground with the aliens they shot my hand off like this a bunch of wacky dudes underground there's bases they're shooting lasers through the Earth's crust and the movement at light speed there's a lot of those guys they seem schizophrenic they seem crazy they might even be disinformation agents they might be people that are designed to muddy the waters which force or has happened Esau was coming forward there now it's amazing and by doing this what you're doing you're providing an opportunity just for Bob to tell his story you know believe it or not he can tell his story it's amazing because more people will come forward now that are involved with these projects they'll come forward with you to me they're coming forward and so what you've done here is provide that opportunity if they need it and it's amazing I just want to say Bob just don't come forward no don't come forward - Bob why why were you freaking nauseous at the beginning of this like so upset why was your why'd you have a migraine because that started off so hard my god us in here like did this why are you asking him why because obvious anxiety the guy's gone to 30 [ __ ] years of being persecuted his birth certificate I want to hear him say I want them by you guys to say that you did it I stepped out settle down yeah well I get it your is hard for you to get him here you know us yeah well what really annoys me are the people that sing you know you guys just came up with the story to make a bunch of money or get a bunch of you know attention and that's a good point so please explain that any money out of this at all and I'm a I didn't even let you guys buy plane tickets for me to come out here or anything I mean any time like when Jeremy pre previewed I guess the movie up in Michigan I mean they it brought in like a couple thousand dollars I made sure that two thousand dollars went to science programs at the local high schools their dirty money I don't want to touch it I don't take any money from this stuff and as far as attention I hate [ __ ] attention I don't like being on shows I just want to kind of hide in the corner and do my own thing so that's I got enough hugs when I was a kid okay I don't need any attention so now the if if you if you think somehow we came up with this thing then you got to tell me why we did it well you've done a great job of making sure you have your bases covered in that regard that you haven't profited off of this and like you said that you have donated whatever money that came your way to science programs it's I mean it it doesn't make any sense any other way I mean what your but I've got gotten out of here is what I thought I was going to get out of here when I watched a documentary that you what you're saying makes sense it doesn't make sense that it's [ __ ] that happened exactly like I said it did Joe I believe you in closing is there anything else you'd like to say no I can't think of anything other than really don't come and try to visit me well I know that you have paid a huge personal cost to get this information out and I mean maybe you didn't understand what that cost would have been when you first initially came forward with the story but over the past thirty years it's been immense it's been great and I just wanna thank you for that and thank you for all these people that would not have gotten this information and would not have really had this story any other way no thanks Jim thank you and thank you Jeremy and one more time the documentary is available on Netflix right now yeah it's called bob lazar area 51 and flying saucers alright that's it folks good night [Music] [Applause] [Music] ",3
57,F8kH0QXsSgU,[Music] did you guys hear about the migrant caravan heading to the united states from honduras i got to tell you about this because the mainstream marxist media just doesn't want you to know about it that by the way is what we do here at disney news we tell you about stuff the media wants to hide i call that lying by omission so what to do click the subscribe button click the bell to stay informed rather than be misled and click the thumbs up button while you're at it the mainstream marxist media made mention of it a few days ago but then they just dropped it from the news cycle the reason is some people are calling this the coveted caravan the reason is it was stopped before it even reached mexico the migrants from honduras were put on buses and sent packing sent back home so why is so little been said about this well i'll tell you the reason is that the far left mainstream marxist media doesn't like to admit defeat and it was a major win for patriots and a major loss for globalism yes we are in fact winning let's think about this for just a second now shortly after donald trump took office the sorrows inspired left began a caravan of caravans one after the other marching through guatemala and mexico to the usa it was a veritable invasion according to some right of center pundits that caravan of caravans however came to an abrupt end even before the coronavirus scared too cold how did trump do it well for one he built the wall as promised but second and more importantly and this is what everyone is missing he created a buffer zone are you listening that stretches from the northern border of mexico to the southern border of guatemala yes think of guatemala and mexico as one massive border wall the driving distance or walking distance if you want to walk it from honduras to the usa is about 2 558 miles give or take a few inches by convincing the governments of guatemala and mexico to stop those caravans donald trump has effectively erected a wall that is nine 1900 fifty four miles wide and two thousand five hundred fifty eight miles deep one thousand nine hundred fifty four miles is the length of the usa mexico border and 2558 miles is the distance from honduras to the usa that my friends is a massive wall speaking of handing globalism a major defeat did you know the president of guatemala is a sane right of center patriot some would call him a trump clone i don't think i'm going to go that far it's a bit overstated but yeah he is a sane right of center patriot he's one of us and yes central americans like americans in the usa are fed up with globalism they're fed up with crime they're fed up with corruption alejandro j mente won the presidency in guatemala on august 11 2019 with 57.96 percent of the vote guatemala's new president-elect alejandro giamatti on his fourth attempt the man they called the eternal candidate has finally won i'm very happy happy and satisfied with the results with the confidence of the guatemalan people but who is giamatte a conservative who aims to resolve what polls say are guatemalan's top two concerns the first security there's a lot of crime and you're afraid to go out because there are many thieves [Music] plans to get tough bringing back the death penalty and restricting rights for gang members in jail and the second a lack of jobs that leads to guatemala sending more people to the u.s border than any other country the problem is that since there's no work in guatemala many people migrate and sometimes it's sad what happens to those who die or get killed while searching for a new future to help their family dear mates promised to stop that creating jobs by increasing tourism and foreign investment to build what he calls an economic wall but even before he took office president donald trump summoned the outgoing president to sign a deal to stop the caravans or face stiff consequences stiff consequences meaning tariffs this way i'll confirm it added to all this is an unexpected challenge a deal just signed by the outgoing president with the us it says that migrants crossing the country mainly from honduras and el salvador have to ask for asylum in guatemala rather than continue to the states if it's ratified it could mean tens of thousands of new arrivals mr giamatte doesn't want that deal but he may have to take it the u.s is threatening tariffs if not so the outgoing president signed on you may notice the dower look on his face as he signs but he signed yes my friends the era of globalism is crashing down hard thanks to alpha males like donald trump and alejandro giamette we are winning they're losing and come november 3 2020. we're looking forward to sending joe biden back to his isolated insulated white neighborhood in delaware ,3
58,pzxjkx-szPY,[Music] relax it's gonna be okay I'm not the one I was joking she'd not believe me she got worried oh yeah she got worried you were you worried the way the world is not gonna end I promise you I promise you busy bee I know it's gonna be okay I promise I was just joking for the video relax it's not gonna end I promise I will I promise huh last time I joke with her around she's see how easy people get so wrapped up in this stuff you know so easily just brainwashed into this [ __ ] you saw blizzy perfect example she was extremely worried that the world was gonna end I comforted it a little bit she understands now I think we're gonna be okay but um you know the bullshit's out there and what are we gonna do they've always got people all and fair of so much [ __ ] and they do often do so much crap I can understand to it a certain extent they don't you know just take a look for example we got goddamn mr. Miyagi yes that's right mr. Miyagi in Florida [ __ ] up on the emergency Broadcasting System which is a double failsafe system I've explained that before you can't make mistakes with the system so in other words the master of wax on wax off somehow [ __ ] up on the button apparently he's got slick moves but can't you know flip the button correctly even though it's a supple failsafe bun but whatever yeah there's there's no joke I mean read it it was unclear what the original image reflects but Hawaii Emergency Management administrator Vern Miyagi yes you can't make this [ __ ] up mr. Miyagi that was his name that [ __ ] up on the system but anyways I digress let's move on to some more bizarre [ __ ] in this world because why not you know why the [ __ ] not alright let's see here mysterious beam weapon strikes Michigan feds claim meteor well you know here's the thing it looked like a meteor at one point but then it didn't because it had this weird streak which also lets look like a Laser laser weapon do we really know what it is no it's gonna take some further investigation what we do know is there's a lot of bizarre [ __ ] going on with what we can assume to be some type of directed-energy weapons or dews you might say it's been going on for a while you know a lot of people have different feelings and when they're used where their use and whatnot what we do know is that they have these things out there there's government patents on them we know they exist and we also know our government likes to test things so are they gonna be using them in some cases probably should they be using them on or practicing or testing them on the American people or American soil no they should not or any other person's soil but they do it anyways because they're douchebags and that's what our military industrial complex does it [ __ ] us in the you know what really hard every chance they can get alright so you know there was film I think many people saw it many different pictures and all the different three-letter agencies and every else and four-letter agencies now we're going to worry about too but anyways they all report the same thing meteor meteor but when you look at a picture like this you know I'm not alone you bring this up a little bit bigger here you know that streak I don't know man that seems like it came from something different than what a natural meteor meteors do have a streak but the lasting residue behind it I don't know sure to hell don't look like a meteor to me could have been maybe I'm not a meteor expert you'd have to consult one of them but you know some of these pictures are just not making sense to what a meteor will look like they're the ones that really bothered me is as you saw something happening with some of these you know you could tell they were people's home security cameras and whatnot and when this light flashed by it basically lit up the night sky like it was day and now that's kind of crazy so definitely something bizarre but some of these actual videotapes and why not did seem to show something that looks like a meteor I think this may be one of them so I'm gonna play it real quick no see this could be it now see that looks like a meteor okay but then we get to you know the whole thing of the rod of God you know I'm gonna play this out first [Music] let's find out about the rods of God which shown tremendous impact in the movie GI Joe tooth Rod's of God is a new weapon being developed by US Air Force that uses the kinetic energy China is also developing the same weapon under the name of the Canes of God rods of God has already started to develop since the 1980s at the beginning it was planned to drop about 100 tons of spheres but with the problem of the cost of orbital placement due to its heavy weight it was converted into a way of destroying ground targets by rapidly dropping sand depleted uranium or tungsten rods it is a good strategy to reduce weight and increase speed by making it into a rod shape because the kinetic energy is proportional to the weight and proportional to the square of the velocity the choice of increasing the velocity is much more effective rods of God is planned to destroy a huge area by dropping 12 tungsten rods from an altitude of 1000 kilometers rods of God is a terrifying weapon with many advantages since it's not dropped from a satellite hey did you hear what he just said what they said it could be let me see if I can rewind it just a second here replay that make sure you listen to hear what he says in weapon with many advantages as it is dropped from a satellite it can hit the targets as it can be dropped from a set satellite and a baby satellite all right now let's think about this for a second all right think about think about what he said will be dropped from the satellite all right let's go here we're gonna jam on over to here and what we got here now we've got SpaceX apparently lost the classified Zuma payload from its latest launch isn't that lovely when they just lose [ __ ] okay the latest SpaceX launch that sexy launch successfully okay blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah that it does its payload is thought to have been falling back to the Earth's atmosphere after reaching space it's because of a failure to separate bla bla bla and it was believed to be a satellite that they were carrying okay all right you hear that I see that again right here let's blow that up a little okay I blew that I can't blow it up the Zuma payload it was carrying a mysterious classified piece of cargo for the US government believed to be a spy satellite well could have been a spy satellite that had a rod of God in it hmm we don't know because apparently they lost it you know not sure how you don't have GPS on multibillion-dollar pieces of equipment or whatever a [ __ ] they cost but anyways I digress it's also kind of interesting that this picture here you know looks a lot like the rudder out of God but so you gotta sometimes put things together you know we've got SpaceX ilium L on L a.m. Moscow what are freaked up morons name is cuz he's a [ __ ] idiot because he cuz involved with the [ __ ] so I don't matter how smart you are if you get involved with the deep state then the world otter the Illuminati's [ __ ] you're a piece of [ __ ] loser [ __ ] idiot anyways so we got dumbasses flying [ __ ] into space losing it in space or here I don't know where they lost at how [ __ ] should I know they lost it but anyways the shit's lost it might be a spy satellite the satellite might contain a rod of God and then we got [ __ ] falling down you know maybe they thought the [ __ ] was gonna fall down in Hawaii and then they put an alert out and then maybe they were wrong and then it falls down and [ __ ] Michigan because three days later is when it actually fell down and that's when Michigan had their little [ __ ] so here's the thing mr. Miyagi there you know mr. Miyagi the administrator of the emergency [ __ ] down Hawaii he might not have been wrong they might have actually been literally legitimately worried about [ __ ] like a rod of god falling out of the sky because SpaceX can't get [ __ ] right because they're subcontracted and you know the subcontractors always try to cut cost you've hired them before the you know the subcontractor alien douchebag Tesla motor [ __ ] bike [ __ ] he loses a goddamn spy satellite that may or may not have a rod of God and they may have thought it was actually fall down so he [ __ ] pushes the button oh [ __ ] and then it didn't fall down and then three days later it falls down to Michigan could it all been a PSYOP share all this stuff can rustle up but you know here's the thing when it comes to the government I think they're fuck-ups and half the time they're stupid so it could have all this [ __ ] could have been legitimate but it's not legitimate because they should have never been doing this [ __ ] in the first place so it doesn't matter if it was a PSYOP and they were just doing the test and the American people or they actually got worried because they totally [ __ ] up in space which I definitely believe they would do because they're all [ __ ] idiots I don't know either way we need to stop these idiots if they are sending the right of God up in the sky and space and they can't keep track of it that's a problem and if it was just a big all sigh up that's a problem so no matter which way it's looked at weathers by their non conspiratorial people I'm more on the side of it was all big sigh up because I usually that's what they do they do nothing but psyops so I'm more on that side but for the people I've been on the other side that may have believed that you know this stuff was all little Gintama and all this in that and here's the thing I thought it was a moment if it was a meteor my guess is they did something to aim it towards us or whatever who do [ __ ] knows we have a [ __ ] up government but what I'm saying is these people are [ __ ] they're garbage they're the scum of the earth from alien Mouse to Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton to George Soros to Bill Gates you name it they're douchebags they they're playing with way too much toys expensive toys when there's people starving in this world there's people all over this world that are hungry we have people in our own country tonight we have children in our own country tonight that are not gonna be able to eat dinner because they don't have the money because government is wasted you got stupid [ __ ] so no matter which way you look at it we need to care and we need to do something about these [ __ ] now if I could figure out how to turn this thing off ,2
59,4UjqFaQq_7I,"this week in our series of reports on UFOs we learned a number of things that not everybody who sees a UFO is crazy that our government has lied about UFO information that it's withheld UFO files and even spied on UFO witnesses we've also heard from scientists who say life elsewhere in the universe is virtually a certainty and we heard the majority of Americans believe that UFOs are real and come from space tonight in part five of his report George Knapp introduces us to a local man with an amazing and disturbing story George Gary and Mary Ruth though we've been working on the story for a long time and will tell you right up front that it's going to be hard to swallow at first this week we've heard the contention of UFO researchers that there is a secret government within our government while that may be hard to believe coming from the UFO perspective we've certainly learned in Watergate and the iran-contra scandal that factions within our government can and do pursue pursue their own hidden agendas outside of the law outside the control of Congress or the Knology of the American people this is exactly the type of operation we'll hear about tonight it's a chilling scenario with worldwide implications that may have its roots right here area 51 that mysterious corner of the Nevada Test Site is no longer much of a secret the fact that secretive things go on here is a given even to the Soviets who make daily spy flights over the facility to take a peek at what's going on these photos never before shown in public are about as close as anyone will ever come to seeing what the place looks like again the dry bed of groom Lake corrugated metal buildings a three mile long runway and some highly sophisticated radar and detection equipment it's been known by many names over the years dreamland the ranch the skunk works if ever there was a place to test a secret new technology this is it and that's exactly what's been done here for decades area 51 is where Francis Gary Powers and the other YouTube pilots were trained in the 50s and where the u2 itself was developed the sr-71 spy planes that spotted Soviet missiles in Cuba in the early 60s were also developed at 51 51 is where stealth technology was nurtured where star wars devices are still tested and were all manner of CIA monkey business has been plotted and refined it's the perfect place for secret things but of course that's no secret 51 is ringed by the forbidden vastness of the Nevada Test Site by the looming groom mountains and by sparsely populated desert expanses the few people who do live out here have no love lost for the military but they're conservative patriotic and they mind their own business ever see stuff you can't explain sure Rochester care to elaborate no on any given night at the Rachel Bar and Grill you might find three or four people who work at area 51 there amid the flowing Budweiser's and cowboy hats you might find them but they aren't going to talk to you not about the things they've seen over the mountains a steady trickle of curiosity seekers flows through here strangers drawn by strange stories of lights in the night sky their questions also go unanswered no one who's worked at dream land has ever publicly acknowledged what so many people have suspected for years that alien technology is being tested in the Nevada desert the speculation first surfaced in documents obtained by UFO researchers documents about something called Project Aquarius the documents allegedly prepared for an organization called mj-12 state that a program to fly recovered alien spacecraft was established in 1972 and is continuing in Nevada the National Security Agency has confirmed it does have a project Aquarius but denies it has anything to do with flying saucers NSA will not say what project Aquarius is speculation was heightened in 1984 when the Air Force seized nearly 90,000 acres around groom Lake the action was by most accounts illegal during congressional hearings about the land grab Congressman John Seiberling grilled the military about the legal authority used in the action and was told the authority was at a much much higher level than the airforce Seiberling asked what authority is higher than the laws of the United States the Air Force official said he could respond but only in a closed briefing in 1987 when the Air Force sought to renew its stranglehold on the groom range new czar once again mentioned the talk about alien spacecraft and subsequent articles in national magazines quoted unnamed sources about things of alien origin flying in Nevada things that would make filmmaker George Lucas drool despite the speculation no one who knew area 51 from the inside ever talked publicly about the saucer stories well there's several actually nine flying saucers flying discs that are out there of extraterrestrial origin the live interview with the shadowy dentist drew international attention portions were broadcast by radio and six European countries and in a nationally televised TV special in Japan Jono Netanyahu Mogens you and I keep it under actually nine flying saucers flying test despite numerous inquiries and feelers Denis has remained anonymous until now his real name is Robert Lazar a young scientist with eclectic interests the choice of Dennis was an inside joke he says that's the name of his superior at Groom Lake it wasn't a joke to Dennis he called right after he said you have any idea what we're gonna do to you now and I said well no she hung up the phone Lazare story is by any standards fantastic he says he's telling it in order to protect himself he says he was hired to work at an area called s4 which is a few miles south of groom Lake and s4 he says are flying saucers antimatter reactors and other working examples of technology that is seemingly beyond human capabilities right this this came from somewhere else I mean in the bizarre as that is to believe but I mean it's there I saw it I know what the current state of the art is and in in physics and it's it can't be done checking out lazarre's credentials proved to be a difficult task he says he earned degrees in physics and electronics but the schools we contacted say they've never heard of him he also said he worked as a physicist at Los Alamos National Lab where he experimented with one of the world's largest particle beam accelerators a half mile long behemoth capable of generating 700 million volts those Alamos officials told us they had no records of a Robert Lazar ever working there they were either mistaken or were lying a 1982 phone book from the lab lists Lazar right there among the other scientists and technicians a 1982 clipping from the Los Alamos newspaper profiled Lazar and his interest in jet cars - mentioned his employment at the lab as a physicist we called Los Alamos again an exasperated official told us he still had no records on Lazar EG&G which is where Lazar says he was interviewed for the job at s4 also has no records it's as if someone has made him disappear while they're trying to make me a non-person they explained you called where well the schools that I went to the hospital that was born it passed job and essentially nothing comes up with my name in it he smiles but out of futility knowing the whole thing must sound ridiculous according to Lazar his employer was the United States Navy he says he and other government employees would gather near EG&G flight a groom lake and then a very few people would get into a bus with blacked-out or no windows and drive to s4 will you get off the bus what do you see very interesting building it's got a slope of probably about 30 degrees the which are hangar doors and it has textured paint on it but it's it looks like sand it's made to look like the side of the mountain and it's and whether it's to disguise it from satellite photographs or what he says he was never told exactly what he'd be working on but figured it had something to do with advanced propulsion on his first day he was told to read a series of briefings and immediately realized how advanced the propulsion was the power source is an antimatter reactor they run gravity amplifiers there's actually two parts to the drive mechanism it's just it's a bizarre technology there's no physical hookup between any of the systems in there they use gravity as a wave using wave guides almost like microwaves it took a while Lazar says before he actually saw one of the flying disks however there were hints everywhere right they had a poster and it looked like a commercial poster almost like it was lithographed and you could buy it at a Kmart or something but they were all over the place and it had the the disc that I coined the term of the sport model was lifted off the ground about three feet at areas four on the dry lake there and the cash on the bottom said they're here and that those are just all over the place later he got to see the real thing when I was let in that was the first time I saw the sport model in the hanger sitting down and I was told they could have walked me in the front door but they purposely wanted to walk me by it I stole not to say anything and just keep my eyes forward and and walk past the desk into the office area and I did and as we went by it I just kind of stuck my hands on it just to run it alongside the thing and you know I that was about the smallest time after that I got to see it actually lift off the ground and operate but you you also in between that you saw more than one yeah the hangars are all connected together and there are large bay doors between each one and there were nine total that I saw each one being different like the head the assortment pack security at s4 was oppressive Lazar says and his superiors used fear and intimidation almost as a brainwashing tool did everything but physically hurt me what a gun gearhead yeah and and said what what actually put a gun to you well they did they did that even in this in the original security briefings they had guards there with m16s a guy is slamming their finger into my chest screaming in my ear some people appointing weapons at me like I said it's not a it's not a good place to work that fear factor would surface later those are agreed to undergo a polygraph exam as part of this report pellagra for Ron slay asked about the technology Lazar had seen did you knowingly lie when you said you had actually seen anti-gravity propulsion in operation the results of this exam were inconclusive Lazar appeared to be truthful on one test deceitful on a second slay recommended that a second examiner be brought in polygraph her and Terry tavern Eddie runs a corporate security operation and is a former Los Angeles police officer he put Lazard through four tests and concluded there was no attempt to deceive and I left there thinking that I feel we do have some credibility to what the subject had to say and that's when I went to some of my colleagues tavern Eddie sent the test results to a third pellagra fer who agreed the results appeared truthful the charts were then sent to a fourth examiner who did not agree suggesting Lazar might be relating information he'd learned from someone else the polygraphers conferred and decided they would not issue a final statement on truthfulness until more specific testing can be conducted and that's where it stands tavern Eddie believes that difficulty in determining lazarre's truthfulness stems from the fear that was drilled into him I think we're talking about a subject here that is so far-reaching and it is so emotional and when you're dealing with emotions this is polygraph because we're dealing when polygraph you're looking at fear the fear of getting caught telling a lie because something bad will happen to you if you do well I am telling the truth I've tried to prove that what's going on up there could be the most important event in history you're talking about contact physical physical contact and proof of from another another system and other planet and other intelligence that's got to be the biggest event in history period and it's real and it's real and it's there and I had an extremely small part in it but I'm convinced at what I saw is absolute proof of that there is there is no way we could have created those systems there's no way we could have made the disc the power supply's anything to go with them well czar says he has no intention of going on in a UFO lecture circuit he's not looking to do any additional interviews in fact he wasn't too crazy about doing this one he did it after certain unfavorable things started happening in his life and he did it because he feels that whoever is running the show but s4 is perpetrating a fraud on the American people and on the scientific community we intend to have much more about this story about the operation up there on Monday and beyond this is by no means at the end of this series of reports in fact on Monday including in our story their support testimony from other people who say they have knowledge of the flying discs at the test site and information from people who Nola's are very well and insist his story is true if indeed they have these flying saucers George it seems like be really hard to keep it so secret well yeah what's it would seem that way except for as Lazar asked his superiors up there they say it's the easiest secret in the world to keep it's leaked out many times before and nobody believes it but what's the Navy saying about all of this well of course the Navy is supposed to have been his his employer and we have put some fairly pointed questions and questions to them of course number one it may not be the Navy at all information is so compartmentalized up there no one is exactly sure who is in charge we have put the questions to several Navy departments the answers thus far have been unsatisfactory we've applied for more information through the Freedom of Information Act and that information will be revealed on Monday as well you believe your story don't you yeah I do yeah I've got to know him pretty well over the last couple of months and I believe he's telling the truth fascinating stuff thanks George ",3

61,lgM8SoLzC3U,hey what's up my name is Ross I want to talk today about vaccines and how they affect kids and how they're pushing them at the doctor's office and as well as fluoride my daughter had to check out the other day and I vaccinated my first three kids because I didn't know better but we went to the doctor and they asked us if she has had any of her vaccines and we told him no and they kept trying to push it of course and then they had a dentist coming in seer and asked what I knew about fluoride hidden I just looked at her and I told her well it's put in the water you legally and it causes cancer and she just kind of laughed at me and about the vaccines when I told him you know that they put mercury in a minute chances are it's causing all the autism all the ADHD all the behavior disorders that we see in kids today she said that has been disproven well how was that disproven when they put aluminum in the vaccines they put msg in the vaccines they put formaldehyde and the fact scenes and they put mercury in them and these shocks are supposed to help our kids I donor stand it I never will I'm actually getting to the point that it is a really pissing me off when these doctors asked to poison my kids and I think a lot of people need to be aware that a lot of people need to start getting angry about this because it's utter BS I mean seriously so I just want to make this short video I will be making more of these videos in the future I've been a truther for about five years now and just now wanting to spread the word myself because all these babies all these little kids deserve a chance me myself I have six kids my first three were vac native my last three were not and sorry to say that my last three are developing so much better so much better than my first three did one of my first three has Asperger's autism because he got the shops and so I would like to put this warning out for everybody please take heed please listen do your own research don't listen to me but do your own research vaccine kill they dumbed down the population they caused mass diseases okay these diseases like the hepatitis B when they give the you know just hours old newborn I've heard that it takes a 250-pound man to process the mercury to tend them safely yeah my kids will never get vaccines ever so thanks for listening have a good day ,2
62,-knwgFx7BLQ,okay well I wrote the book plague along with my co-author Kent eken lively because I thought it was important to tell the story and the truth of what happened and what's involved in retroviruses in medical research that is corrupted by special interests and in groups when one finds an inconvenient truth it's really important that medical research be free of censorship and that the stories and the data that we that we work diligently and paid funded by taxpayers be presented to to the people and to to their other research communities unbiased it's it's incredibly important that even if we don't understand data that we show all the data and and make certain that we don't miss something in treating patient communities who are suffering with devastating diseases that are it epidemic proportions ,2
63,sVYK9-esCKY,it was up hilltop here in this video let's get into the truth about what happened to epsteen epsteen the the pedophile a sex trafficker right so he was actually killed he was not he was not suicidal he did not commit suicide he may have been suicidal but his final days were done by others for reasons I don't understand the Ville and I that's pretty much what I want to point out oh and the spiritual reason why he why he did a spiritual the spirituality behind it is that is that the the underlying consciousness of certain egos particularly one major ego the reciprocal of the one who the one who runs the place doesn't you know can't get away with having children so he ploy to find the way and Epstein showed up because some egos weren't alive with him and so for a certain time that was a coping mechanism for the later half of I guess this past century the one before 2000 and and that's what they lived off of for a little bit for pedophiles to survive and obviously that was a bad organization but the spiritual reason is because there was a need for pedophilia and there's no way to get it and the reason why doesn't make sense is because you have to be an elite right so these underlying forces that are the foundation of our desires they don't care as much about people not getting that their needs met they care about themselves because they figured oh if one body doesn't get it I'll get those desires in a different body because these birds are traveling right so if I can't get in one by to go to that body and in a sense there is justice to it because if it leaves and it focuses more on that body you'll have those desires less so it kind of makes sense but not always sometimes people's lives in such a way their focus is on it more and so all those spirit goes comes and goes different places the the desire the desire I remain so it's not like a just system because people will suffer for a long time and with with these desires you know even though there's there's supposedly this phenomenon where it's the spirit that gives you the desire it's not so simple the person's wiring can force a spirit to feel pained by that situation so when it comes to the body it says this person has to have it I feel pain because the spirit is it's a foundation on the body and it's giving over its pain receptors and will into the body itself so that's kind of how it works so the left side thing was supposed to loosen things up but it's it didn't care about the 1% and it was very surrenders because you have all kinds of rituals and and of course it's it's organized and hogging all the it's trying to keep it in in a 1% zone and there was no sensitivity or safeguards or over oversight over the system and the whole thing should not have been should not have been allowed with should not have been allowed it was illegal but it was allowed it was allowed by the elites or by people who were not stepping in to do anything about it and that reflects a certain gap between the rich and the poor the rich and those who down on money were the elites and all that money and why the elite should be should be taxed and should be good you know should be contributing greatly into making sure they're not hogging a bunch of money for the sake of making more money there you have the truth about the upside he did not commit suicide there's a special reason why he was successful in creating such a thing the spiritual reasons are not necessarily accurate or logical and and ,2
64,QDIfFb5z7eQ,good evening and welcome to tucker carlson tonight joe biden went to pittsburgh today maybe you saw it he announced his administration has decided to guarantee economy destroying crippling hyperinflation by funding yet another multi-trillion dollar spending bill biden claimed this batch of newly printed money will go to quote infrastructure infrastructure you're thinking sparkling new bridges and roads and airports that's funny no it doesn't mean that biden has a different kind of quote infrastructure in mind the kind that will definitely not improve your life we're taking a close look at that plan tonight and we will have details for you tomorrow but first tonight what if your next door neighbor suddenly went dangerously insane and started holding people hostage in his house would you consider that threatening would you even notice it those are not theoretical questions something very much like that just happened in our national neighborhood canada the landmass directly to our north our single largest trading partner the country with whom we share the longest international border in the world canada took a dramatic move toward legitimately dangerous authoritarianism in canada yes here's just one measure of it on monday the country's prime minister justin trudeau outlined his government's new corona regulations canadians hoping to return to their country must be tested before and after takeoff he said quote if your test results come back positive you'll need to immediately quarantine in designated government facilities this is not optional designated government facilities now when this happens in other countries and it does we call those facilities internment camps but because this is canada we're talking about a place we assume is passive and polite and anglo to the point of parity no one thinks to use that term in fact no one thinks about it at all trudeau's internment policy has been in place since last month and as far as we can tell no major u.s network has even mentioned it and neither has our state department which ordinarily seems to exist to make unhappy noises about human rights violations around the world but not a word about canada preconceptions may play some role here we assume that in turning people is what russia does boring people is what canada does but not anymore suddenly canada is a flagrant violator of the most basic human rights fail a covid test and they will lock you up without trial and go ahead and try to disobey according to the canadian government anyone who attempts to avoid these rules detention in a government internment facility for example could face a million dollar fine and three years in prison this is justin trudeau's canada it's funny trudeau always seemed like a cheerful idiot wearing weird costumes and yammering on about diversity who knew he was mussolini there might be a lesson here for other nations that are led by shallow neo-liberal empty suits know any underneath all the chirpy identity politics talk it's not a joke it's internment cells in canada where everything has a euphemism those cells are referred to as approved quarantine hotels what are they like well as noted they're internment cells what do you think they're like there are shortages of food and water you could be sexually assaulted as you're held in one listen to a member of the canadian parliament explain what they're like the liberals instituted a federal hotel quarantine requirement for those entering canada we have heard reports that is taking hours to get through to book these hotels dietary restrictions are not being met and food and water is not always readily available that's in addition to this program continuing after reports of sexual assault this is mind-boggling oh the liberals did this it's not very liberal to intern people is it according to a report in the post-millennial the doors in many of the internment facilities don't lock detainees have no way to protect themselves while they sleep hence the sexual assault they also don't have access to adequate medical care in one case canadian authorities detained a man with diabetes called ray truesdale what was true dale's criminal was flying from tennessee to toronto on a business trip as he waited in confinement for his corona test results his jailers forgot to feed truesdale for more than 24 hours ultimately truesdale left his cell and went downstairs in search of something to eat and there he found others who were being held without food they were screaming he said in the end canadian authorities informed truesdale that his coronavirus sample had been damaged somehow so he had to remain in internment or consider mitch bolu a canadian who landed in calgary after a business trip to florida he told canadian television the experience was very much like a kidnapping he was put quote in a black van with tinted windows and taken to an undisclosed location where am i going he asked why am i going there the response will tell you everything when you get there he thought it was a prank he thought it had to be but it wasn't a prank quote i got out there and there was plastic all over people walking around in hazmat suits it was like jail pretty much yeah just don't call it jail and that's an order directly from canadian state media this fall the cbc canadian state media ran a story with this headline prime minister health officials warn canadians against believing covid19 internment camps disinformation warn them against believing sound familiar that claim that conspiracies theory said cbc that the federal government is preparing to forcibly intern canadians is patently false the cbc assured canadians the government was preparing quote voluntary quarantine sites yeah voluntary in the sense of being mandatory which is what they are they're mandatory and by the way as a matter of science how does packing infected people into crowded internment facilities reduce the spread of the coronavirus that's a good question and some have asked the canadian government that very question but they haven't explained we do know and this is significant that canada has fallen far behind other advanced nations in distributing the vaccine which is interesting given the decades of propaganda all of us here have been subjected to about the glories of the canadian healthcare system according to andrea taylor who researches this at duke canada quote had more faith in the global supply chain than other countries oh they believed it worked the globalism thing that turned out to be a big mistake but rather than admit that globalist stupidity is why they can't get vaccines to their population justin trudeau has decided to punish his own citizens it's his fault and the population gets punished do you recognize that impulses look familiar to you it should because neo-liberalism is always the same no matter where you find it what's so interesting is that canada's new rules apply only to covid patients other transmissible diseases are exempt people with aids aren't being sent to internment facilities thank god no one's tried that since fidel castro did it in the 1980s drug-resistant tuberculosis is fine too that's a real problem but not in canada only covet a disease with a 98 survival rate weirdly too and you may recognize this as well at the same moment they're clamping down on travel by their own citizens the canadian government has announced plans to admit 400 000 new permanent residents from other countries over the next eight months and by the way that number will increase substantially over the next couple of years none of those people those immigrants from the third world will be forcibly quarantined in canada we're not calling for them to be but it's interesting the difference they won't be arrested in fact they'll be rewarded because they're not citizens only the citizens are punished back in november justin trudeau admitted what's going on here it's not about coronavirus stopping the virus saving lives no this pandemic he said is an opportunity to permanently change western civilization this pandemic has provided an opportunity for a reset this is our chance to accelerate our pre-pandemic efforts to reimagine economic systems that actually address global challenges like extreme poverty inequality and climate change the great reset and we don't want to give justin trudeau too much credit he may be sinister but he's not smart it's not like he thought that phrase up no he took it from his role models in this country at a forum hosted by the world economic forum in mid-november john kerry our new climate czar laid it out yes he said the great reset will happen and i think it will happen with greater speed and with greater intensity than a lot of people might imagine in effect the citizens of the united states have just done a great reset we've done a great reset and it was a record level of voting we're at the dawn of an extremely exciting time has it been extremely exciting for you has it been extremely exciting for most americans as the people in charge mismanaged this country all the way to the brink no it probably hasn't been it's been a sad time for most people but for power mad leaders hoping to eliminate centuries of constitutional restraints on their own ambitions it is indeed an exciting time could what is happening in canada happen here that's the question that's the whole point of this segment you might not think so we don't need internment cells here because unlike canada we have the vaccine and we're distributing it to tens of millions of people and once you're vaccinated you can live normally that's the whole point of getting vaccinated but then you wonder if that's true why are joe biden and kamala harris still wearing their silly little obedience masks everywhere they go they've been vaccinated so is everyone around them so why the masks why the restrictions what exactly is going on here we know it's not science we know that for certain according to the cdc once you are vaccinated of course you don't need a mask anymore we can kind of almost see the end we're we're vaccinating so very fast our data from the cdcs today um you know that that vaccinated people do not carry the virus don't get sick um and that it's not just in the clinical trials but it's also in real world data well we hope vaccinated people don't carry the virus otherwise why are we getting all these vaccines what's the point turns out the real world data confirms common sense once you get the vaccine you don't need a mask that's a biden employee so why is everyone still wearing it why are people with vaccinations walking alone outside with masks on why are joe biden and kamala harris wearing masks sincere question you'd think our media would ask that once in a while but they're not they're asking very different questions in the other direction in fact they're heckling members of the opposition political party people who've been vaccinated and demanding that despite the vaccination they put their masks back on uh yeah when i'm talking to the tv camera i'm not gonna wear a mask and all of us have been immunized so does it make us feel better you're welcome to step away if you like the whole point of a vaccine cdc guidance is what we're following the whole point of the fantasy as if we needed to be reminded we do because we've lost sight of that that's what the science says but nobody cares what the science says wear your obedience mask immediately it would make us feel better which is the passive-aggressive way of saying do it or else now watching that does make you wonder how would our media react here in the united states if dr fauci one day reluctantly concluded that actually we need coronavirus internment facilities in this country obviously for our safety we don't want to violate anyone's rights but we gotta have them sorry how would our media respond take a look at the clip we just played again look it up on the internet you see that reporter and you realize that person badly wants ted cruz tossed into the back of a black van for coronavirus non-compliance hauled away and not just ted cruz but you too in fact all the disobedient politically inconvenient people held without trial on public health grounds of course until they no longer pose a mortal threat to the rest of us and by the rest of us of course we mean the good people the people who obey you think that couldn't happen here why because the constitution prohibits it you think that couldn't happen in america it just happened in canada ,3
65,u82iSLtylfQ,"and I have a friend I'm a naughty talk I mean I mean auditory from Molly and she said Africa has been moved another means of division by European and Africa from some of the testimony that we gather we have to get my International College in Germany level skier testify to us that in Ghana there is a village where the average living condition the average life expectancy of the people is 2025 years because they are company here in Europe companions in unity oh I went with all the waste products that are toxicated that chemical product and then dumped them in Africa water induced ocean and some of these things attentive lately the population live really close to this area and then also most of this electrical products whether a stab in telephone but means and oldest in a tough waving that positive seen in some of this Africa villages all sorts of ways that destroy this environment and mostly it is women the first person that are affected because in Africa it is the women who went out so shots to fetch water in the rivers and indices and most of these hotels have been polluted by this toxic acid chemical depots in the water by becoming what do you think about this and how do you think these things should be change in the world you know there's a poster behind behind you with a short life products are destroying our future some of the people who would like to turn the climate crisis they've created into a new marketing opportunity there's a lot of language of Bill Gates being a savior of the cop and he's been presented around with heads of state and the language is using is decentralized solar is primitive they want to appropriate all of the land the biomass and all the rich richness that supports life and he is pushing a very dangerous proposal for Africa called Agra the Alliance for the Green Revolution in Africa which basically means chemical fertilizers that's why the first column here is about how much chemical fertilisers an industrial farming contributes to climate change that's Norman Borlaug who adapted plants to chemicals now the big push is coming from Bill Gates so this is a toxic economy and its roots in war all the chemicals we use in agriculture came from war and Bill Gates is the carrier of this toxic future today and then there Monsanto's and their Syngenta's and the fertilizer companies whom I call the exons of agriculture they're driving the language of this Yara Cargill so we've to get out of this toxic economy toxic politics we've got to turn to biodiversity and the earth and we've got to start realizing that for everything that's produced through toxics we have an ecological alternative or the chemical farming we have organic farming for chemical fibers petrochemical fibers we have natural fibers and everything that we do with the earth protects the earth reduces the pollution creates more meaningful work increases democracy so we have two parts very clearly coming out of the cop a Bill Gates riding high and saying I took software which belong to everyone made it my property collected royalties became a billionaire out of nothing out of stolen software and now I'll behave as I found a big philanthropist he's a thief and all of the 1% solutions are solutions of theft and something extremely serious is at stake I have a book called making peace with their Regina the whole chapter on what they calling the green economy where they really are appropriating our language of green and then saying no a woman carrying twigs to make food that's polluting we're gonna ban it people having their own seats we won't allow it so they would like to take the 75% economy of the world which is what I call the biodiversity economy which is all of our countries which is large parts of the new movements in the north and they're trying very hard to say will criminalize that we will define what's innovation we will define what's pollution or will define what's clean will define what's smart these are the code words of their new empire smart innovation clean we want life they don't use the word life is scared of life what about the Geo engineering that's part of the full solution I mentioned here and he's financing it that's what all of you I suggest keep track of Bill Gates he is going to be the biggest good continuum of this model that must change is he linked with that yes fine biggest financier biggest financier of geoengineering projects biggest yeah and Monsanto - isn't with us Monsanto maybe for sure because Monsanto is breathing for heavy metals ok and and because it's a the soy becomes dry with the junior engineering so Monsanto could provide the solution right well you know Monsanto has bought if you if you read that sheet I've given Monsanto has bought the world's biggest climate data corporation it has bought the world's biggest soil data corporation and basically what they're looking forward me we've seen what happened with seed Monsanto said I'm gonna on the seat and I'll collect royalties and I'll push GMOs because that way I can pretend I invented the seed they're now looking for trapping farmers into buying soil and climate data from which is why I am totally against carbon trading because living carbon you know a tree is living calm and I've critiqued the g8 so you can't decarbonize the world we'd be dead what you need to do is get rid of fossil fuels why are they using the term decarbonisation they're using it to make the living carbon economy of people illegal and they enough young people who feel solar wonderful a few twigs dirty no the twigs are recycling the carbon that is fixed in that twig they're not generating carbon emissions beyond the carbon cycle it's a closed cycle fossil burning is going beyond the cycle and I'm reading more in mind since in India first village to become clean to ban biomass and shift of fossil energy and they calling it clean so there's a twist in the perception of what's clean and and they're already waiting to think of not only will they control agriculture mr. Gates has put up the plan for one agriculture one agriculture all universities working through him he is already privatizing the world's public gene banks or the cg system it's called a consultative group offering international agriculture research where our seeds are kept he's using his money to destroy the public's breeding and saying hand this over to the corporation's then soil instead of you knowing what the soil is like instead of a local lab working with farmers to say this is your soil fertility this is your soil food web satellites are going to be used and Monsanto has already made an agreement with deer you know the the tractor company that in those machines they're going to fix Monsanto spyware it's called so when the tractor moves it's going to send the data of what the farmer grew which variety he grew how much prop he had had and they're looking for a total control system that has already destroyed the planet but pretending it's clean and so what do we need what we need at this point is of what much deeper understanding of ecological processes to not get confused with this language a much deeper celebration of life are lies the planet's life and a much deeper courage to say no to this rubbish I have another question let others ask if they have another question does anyone have yeah econ this kind of on the theme centralization of your internal control and corporations I guess just wondering about your comments on to what extent dr. Chiba we will be able to find the solutions within the framework of capitalism where neoliberalism and to what extent those policies that are based upon those that groundwork is actually they're not the way to do well in a change change never comes through abstractions change comes in the concrete and within the concrete you can be in another paradigm okay I might be living in a world dominated by industrial agriculture but for 30 years I have saved seeds I've done organic farming and change the world and created another world you don't have a full systems replacement as a food system replacement except in the mind in the mind you can have an immediate systems change which is called a paradigm change on the ground you grow the alternative just there falling off in my question Wow do you think there are any genuine alliances you can have with multinational corporations so like announced because in the energy company's commitment to actually change the way that they are the CEO state which could be a stand against other motions like yeah you know I'm trained as a physicist I dealt only with abstraction I used to believe the world can be explained in algebraic symbols and words one nonsense I realized today that the only place you can answer any question is in a control situation not an abstract so your question is an abstract question you know it's concrete for Greenpeace they've come to Greenpeace fine but you don't generalize in the concrete to figure out yes this particular company is changing in this way this particular organization feels it has the confidence to not be co-opted by this change it's fine I'd really feel the biggest trap we have right now is living in generalizations we've got to get it the word we have evolved in the organic movement is human humans is living sought living soil is made by living organisms okay the first time I heard the word biochar came from the biofuels Alan Bates might be totally well-meaning but biochar is only making charcoal by burning biomass without oxygen that's all it is and there is an illusion being created that that's the point where carbon dioxide gets fixed no carbon dioxide is fixed in the living plant through photosynthesis there's no new fixing at the time of burning so the first is it's distorting our perception of the carbon cycle and it's making us forget photosynthesis second I have watched and witness and I've heard corporations talk about how now they can send their carbon rich waste as fertilizer in biochar we have to fight coca-cola selling its toxic waste not selling giving its toxic waste and bloody murder as carbon rich fertilizer I've seen a cement factory in Orissa saying here's biochar because in biochar you don't explain the sauce it just has to be carbon rich you can get into the trap that we got into with the mad cow disease cows like to graze grass they made intensive feed the intensive feed has a nice little label this much higher and this much protein this much calcium this is the diet your clown needs cow started to get diseased they just chopped them up rendered them fed them to the cows perfect Constitution perfect the nutrition was perfect give the cows mad cow kill 12 people in England till we had to rice so all I'm saying is let's bring process back into our thinking let us bring transparency into what started as what and ended as what and what did it do along the way what externality is what profits what concentration what toxics so focusing on biochar could make us forget the real responsibility of growing organic matter recycling organic matter enhancing humans the displacement of the word humans is the most dangerous part of the language of biomass and I'm saying some people will be many well-meaning some practices might mix humors and by China it might all work but it's the displacement in our imagination that to me is the place where we are now getting colonized because as it is humanity is so entrenched from its life and any step that takes us further down in strange man throat will let leave us less capable of healing the earth and us yeah yeah I was just going to say so it seems like part of the solution would be that more people participate in community kind of connection to the planet people actually building communities on the ground that reclaimed GMO corn and soya fields and and start building kind of the schools and then the farms that are necessary to actually remediating the planet yeah what can we do to actually encourage this more what do we do to make more people step into this role because it seems like this is a lost it's a lost kind of field of Education or art that many people are not connecting to particularly in the West well the first thing again we have to do is unlearn the idea of the reductionist world view that we are atoms in society that we are each of us individuals locked into loneliness we've got to start realizing that we are of the earth and we are of community even when we pretend in our minds we are isolated if our mothers and fathers one day we wouldn't be here if someone hadn't taken care of us we'd have died along the way so to be aware of the network of ecological and social relationships that make us means to be aware of community earth community social community and then to with that awareness to build the actual links beginning with whatever you're fond of doing if you like to garden reclaim confidence if you like education work with children if you like to shift the economy do what Rob Hopkins does create local currency if what you like to do is healing learn how to heal without the same companies that are giving us the poisons in agriculture than selling us the medicines with bad answer so I've the education is actually also becoming colonized by companies like Monsanto and and the likes of them is it time for a radical shift to you know drop out of schools because if we're going to send our children to the places where they're going to come back and learn the ways of monks Angeles is paradigm is the time to just turn away from the traditional education system I put it in a different way is it time to build another education system and I would say yes that's why not only am I nemanja for seed saving organic farming I built an earth University for another education and you can all go to the website of navdanya I think it's written here www.annualcreditreport.com jet has economy it has democracy and it has education how Finland which has the highest performance rates in in-school education just gave up the old model and learnt from Monty Surrey and Steiner to create a public education system so it is time for another education because all our education you know if you think of it early education was the Scholastic's the church control that gave me with the rise of industrialism and capitalism to university education where you were given a fragmented one-dimensional knowledge to do one thing and you knew nothing else and then now they're telling you well that's not good enough you've got to do and learn totally new things and you have to have new skills but all the skills are to fit into a global economy which has placed for three percent humanity you've done these calculations we have three percent humanity would be controlled we would have space in a corporate global economy and that means the rest are redundant so of course you need another education yeah you are completely describing how I see tennis we can act completely well you were mentioning the communities best in 2015 70% of the population in the urban so do you think we have to in the urban scale or we have to go back to the soil and and and the country okay and beginning to work on substitutions one more thing we have to really learn to unlearn because we are made to think in linear pattern and it with an inevitability that this is the way things work we are making urbanization why is there more urbanization because globalization and industrial agriculture has rendered farming unviable through dishonesty Parmesan turning not in France not in in not in Africa because the system is designed to sell high-cost inputs the farmers buy cheap commodities from them that's an economic system that can't sustain itself but the corporation's make it both ways they make profits by selling inputs and mic buying cheap commodities and then they have vertical integration to make profits further down the line so urbanization is not an inevitability my country because the British had exploited ask they left us with a great Bengal famine when we became independent the first thing we did was land reform second thing we did was universal public food security between the two of them the fact that small peasants got a fair price and had a market through the public food meant that small farmers were totally viable in India which is why it's not an accident that India even now is about 60 percent farmers it's my policy design and if we make a policy design that we are going to support small farmers we are going to recognize agro ecology as a science we're going to make sure no one can pay too little for what a farmer produces who would want to be on the left who would want to commute Riaz live in a boring job sit at a computer make money for some speculator we would have a reverse migration of a huge kind that's one part of the question so we need to stop what World Bank wants us to think inevitable that more and more people will move more and more people could move in the other way if we get justice in place and we got more initiatives or I launched here and this group a map and you know we have these I'm going to launch this pact on the fifth it's a pact for the protection of the earth and each other and you're all welcome the French is here and Mike yeah the English is there a map our urban people who became farmers yeah managers chemists and now the art big had brought me here to launch the greater Paris region organic system what are we looking to us at the city instead of Koreans eating junk that's coming from wherever it's cheapest to get they get organic from their closest parts and that that relationship on of a new food economy does two things it allows the citizens to get good food they know is healthy for them but it also allows resources to be plowed back to the farm so that the farm becomes math you need to do that but in addition to that you need to bring the village into the city our when I say village to the city we need to do more than farming it's totally possible it's happening it's the biggest revolution taking place today urban gardens big yeah my last question as promised last my question is doing about solar electrical engineering because my presence the other tip challenge in yangon is graduated to over in Africa my question is that school engineering is a package in electrical engineering system for Africa or it's something that's between more an angle to the people of Africa because I these solar batteries that store this engineering they are very artful to human being to the light of Sicily and most of these things are not taken care by some of this engine are you know from local authority that are controlling and this energy we are just left like that in history and it's very um food especially to children so do you think is something that is people people well you know this is the way we've repeatedly said you need to do full cost account and the full cost includes all ecological externalities and all social externality sir and that's why the language was created which is somehow being forgotten again called lifecycle approach take the lifecycle of a product and then assess ecuador and grease all with you so we need you know it's that third column in this rice poster that's the most important one because there's such rapid spread of for solutions I'm not saying decentralized solar is not good and there is now all kinds of new work being done to get rid of the battery and you don't need the battery all you do is heat your water and the other purposes for which you don't so but Bill Gates is attacking decentralized energy he wants sent centralized systems like I said he wants one agriculture for the whole world he will want one energy system which he controls he's already moving December's come now in December he wanted to launch a microchip for remote control of women's fertility in the third world where the microchip and whether I will have a baby or not will be decided by mr. gates or any institution he creates so I mean he is the most amazing total control freak who could imagine and he's funny lost grin tells me the guy is lost he is lost he doesn't know who he is except that money controls the world that's all he knows you know and you know we are being ruled by insanity it's very serious situation yeah well quickly where could we find the bill Kate if you find it you wait I don't need Bill Gates style of money at all have you notice how much good work is coming through crowdsourcing this film tomorrow was financed through crowdsourcing they didn't have to go to Bill Gates my son who just arrived we're saying I supported this he's a photographer a new bag for photographers he contributed to the crowdsourcing and it comes back to community we will either see ourselves as powerless and we will constantly delegate power to governments that don't care and people like Gates who while pretending to be a philanthropist is only thinking how to make the next back he's actually everything he's doing is making the European business opportunity and we will cause you say oh we're too poor we're just stupid new to Palace minute we reclaim power and say we have the power to make change we have the bathroom community to mobilize resources well you know I feel the organic movement in India only through recycling the money I think in the first time I must have put some money down to make sure the farmers products reach the market but after that it circulate so we have to move from a linear extractive economy but everything moves to the 1% the resources of the earth the wealth of the people into a circular economy where well starts to circulate where energy starts to circulate in nature in community nutrition starts to circulate in nature in community water starts to circulate in nature in community and I want to introduce to you about your Costa who was the person who drafted the Ecuadorian Constitution that recognized the rights of nature which of course is now being undermined and that's a different issue but so you know I think that power is removed from government and from these from the 1% when we remove our focus from them right because I mean we consent to give them power by following them and I think we're already starting to do a good job by being here not doing that and responding to the grassroots so my question is in your experience in India how do you go about celebrating in the farmer more and how do you go about making it more attractive more consumable for people to want to go back to the rural areas so the first is we've done seed into a celebration the seed had been rendered invisible and then it popped us and popped up is mean once an chosen match so we bring out the seeds no do I have I'm going to show you this is our we celebrate next year is the year of pulses so we've already started preparing I've already done an analysis of how you don't have to take fossil fuels burn them at 550 degrees create a toxic fertilizer which ruins the climate 300 times more lethal than carbon dioxide kills our oceans destroys our soils gets removes this wonderful protein from our diet when the pulses do it non-violently with the Rhizobium you know so the diversity we celebrate through food festivals like I said we have an earth University where some courses are about the big picture but many are just how to farm better and I have to tell you in the last 10 years well remind me now Pablos is here from Greece and he spent a very long time with us in India and we're now getting software engineers we are getting financial people people say I made all the money I could but I'm not happy now I want to be a farmer so I always say after everything else it's the soil that's calling you many aboard and rich or you're poor and disposable either way for both of you it's the soil that's calling you and and of course we bring the best of science to it what they call science is not science if you don't know the soil and it's web of life what Monsanto is selling at soil science is what can be measured from a satellite through GPS with you and this can be the chemicals in the soil but not that invisible mica riser which is the real life of the Sun that makes them so all of this knowledge practice celebration and you've eaten a good meal I'm eating a wonderful risotto and I have to tell the chef it is so good talking about Jake you know I've been to the cop at low budget twice it is so miserable they don't even have water to drink it's like torture has to be the way you live and yet the celebration has to be the way you yeah so you mentioned that there's you know a solution that might come from local currencies right putting in money at the beginning but then having that money circulate in and of itself within the community I think fundamentally our financial system is not allowing us to have that kind of that ability to to let that money stay within the pockets of the people right it's always ending up in banks and the banks are controlling interest rates on these things so there's always this kind of financial engineering that is kind of keeping people poor essentially what role do you feel kind of alternative currencies or local currencies might be able to have in you know restoring kind of the I guess the balance in humanity the balance in what we what we really need for those local communities actually thrive when I said circular economy I didn't mean only circulation of money of course yes you know because money is a means at the end of a process per fluid long before that you had circulation of wealth mm-hmm you have a nature give-and-take so for the sound for the countries of the south I think the first step for us is to prevent the commodification of our resources and lines so I have fought against the privatization of water and we won every battle I have fought against patenting of our seeds and biopiracy I have won every bag on that the issue of climate change more complicated I've written a book called soil not oil and there will be copies at the table downstairs where my colleagues are there in soil not oil I've shown how emissions trading is not a solution and in effect what the climate's discourse has done is first you allowed corporations to privatize the atmosphere by dumping their waste they atmospheric waste into the atmosphere in a way climate change is like the garbage dump that we see it's a landfill in the air but causing similar problems then the solution in Kyoto Protocol was oh we will allocate this air and atmosphere to the pollutants so they took a common second time over and hand it over to the polluters who then did emissions trading made lots of money out of it pollution was to come down by five percent went up by 16 percent in the Kyoto career and all this is about beyond quixote now they're working new ways to do more commodification carbon trading soil carbon monitoring data selling all of this has come on it so commodification take something that is ours and a shake turns it into a commodity that we must buy from those who stole it that makes us poorer 300,000 Indian farmers have committed suicide in this model of seed commodification if we don't get the full price for what if we only sell if you only prepare commodities for the global market farmers will always be losers if they grow food for a neighbor they will always have a circular economy that's what it's a map greater Paris region is that's what the navdanya model of circulation is farmers get more they don't have to commit suicide they do organic nothing goes out citizens get healthier food they don't have to spend millions on health care you do a short circuit and that short circuit means both sides do better but corporations you don't need I call it the global heart bypass like the arteries of the global economy are clogged with corporate greed and you can either say oh when will I be big enough to do the surgery on corporations all you can just say oh I'll just do a bypass yeah and the bypass is in our hands to make and that's the community initiative that's the ecological awareness that is the recognition then just because we are of the earth we come with power that's the plant saying oh there's no mr. Bill Gates to fund me to grow that's it that's great I agree with you that the the problem is mr. gates won't stop because we asked him and we are we are obliged to live with these people and how can we deal with them how can you make Bill Gates or these companies your allies or will be kind of a floor or a kind of struggle because it's very important the gates now is a tributary and we are here at gardener but we know that they are very powerful and if we don't try to get everyone I think there will be a lot of people losing if you have any kind of fights so how can we do to make you solution their solution and change the kind of program the kind of software they have in mind I just talked about this bypass yeah but unless they win still is it would still be down there well actually no again when I started to deal with Monsanto I dealt with the recognition that here's a company which had no rule in seeds wanting to control our seeds you don't think of Monsanto as the company that controls the seed we do see it as an illegitimate actor that wants to take control of your scene now if you want to take control of your seed you just stand there and say sorry that's what we have to say to milk it Bill Gates is a newcomer five years ten years ago he starts on ground then he's jumping into this he's already taken over the WH er and the Health System right we can either say oh mr. gates has always been powerful he's always been around no he's an upstart he's an upstart wasn't nobody in the history of the evolution of this planet he's a nobody in the history of evolution of our cultures he's a nobody in the history of democracy and I said it's very wrong that governments which are meeting for an interstate intergovernmental gathering allow him to stand with them they are giving up their power of representing democratic societies and they are inviting him to take control so the two things we have to do first realize he is trying it's like someone's coming to steal your house do you say oh my god you know this man is so powerful and taking the house and now I will have to convince him that he thinks like me no you mobilize the mechanisms that they are to say you can't grab my land or my house because it's illegal theft is illegal we have to do more and more of that we're fine Gates is pushing the GMO golden rice the GMO Bengal in Bangladesh now because he's lost everywhere else if to continue those  fights and the second is we have to build a better alternative which is why we have to increase the vocabulary between his be honest for words they were very rich vocabulary yeah so no diary is that people know the issue is I I don't mind the dialogue I can tell you because I have critiques are girls so much the Alliance for the Green Revolution and the GMOs I have so many friends will say but you should talk to Bill Gates I said sure fix a meeting poor guys 10 years they have spent trying to fix appointment I'm not gonna wait to fix an appointment with me get in my life um soil bacteria is a more significant being on this planet than a bit of it and I'm not going to waste my time seeking an appointment per day but if he comes my way if he comes my way I have I've worked poking at the World Economic Forum in Melbourne he was there I was there he had to come through helicopter i walked in i asked the protesters i said they want me to speak inside if you give me permission i'll go if you don't give me permission i won't they said no for you we will open up they let me go i was there i want to avoid him but I won't kill myself trying to meet ya last how do they are gonna here for why people are walking Bill Gates spaces that government simply will fund the kind of things that he's funding like this hundred billion dollars development and so I'm wondering what you think both in terms of green development and building building local economies what the role of public mining area is while there is some of yes austerity okay no so that's a wrong framing if you look at what is financing a bad agriculture that's killing our health killing the planet destroying our small farmers four hundred billion dollars of subsidies in the OECD country distorting agriculture and wiping out the planet four hundred billion if you begin with only cutting it to half and say and over ten years you cut it to zero because we shouldn't have toxics in our food you already have two hundred billion double the amount you need why make yourself look like you have nothing when all the money is going for the wrong things or chip regardless ",3
66,PTz1Dm9iavk,hello I'm making this video because I want to show you the glory of the power chords that I rely on to power my cellphone and my headphones that only half work one earbud doesn't even work I don't know why don't just cut it maybe I will and the back cover of the book what to do oh no it's really the emotional incest syndrome what to do when a parent's love rules your life everything everywhere happens for a reason everything there's a rhyme and a reason to everything and art is everywhere Paul McCartney has passed from the earth and now lives in the spirit world the band The Beatles was a tool that the Tavistock Institute used to engineer society the nice young men from Manchester England who took the world by storm was presented in contrast to the not-so-nice young men the Rolling Stones and given the choice many gravitated towards the Beatles not knowing that as the Beatles fell into drugs and helped to form the counterculture and you know free love that in choosing this band that would fall from grace they slowly lost their hold on the truths of existence the truth that there is a God the truth that a human being a man or a woman can stand in their own power and attract good into their lives that you can commit a loving act and you are rewarded that all you really have to do in life is trust your Creator and do good be perfect as your heavenly parent is perfect Paul McCartney was replaced with a freemason who was groomed for the job you can see the difference in the facial structure a lot of latex was used some plastic surgery and they created a new Paul McCartney Paul McCartney was as far as people could tell beheaded in a traffic accident and then in the 1960s it was somewhere around there Paul McCartney pass to the spirit world the man who replaced him was placed in the leadership role of this band and although people speculated about it no one knew for sure and that's part of the trickery that's part of the usurpation you present information and you present a counter to that information that acts to confuse you and in your confusion you are manipulated so the freemasons are up to no good you know many people say that the people on the lower levels of Freemason aren't such bad people they don't know what they're doing um there's one problem with that and although I agree with that to a large degree the making of an oath to a group of people and even if it seems like a joke saying that I will never divulge of the secrets of this organization making an oath to anyone that should you break that oath harm will befall yourself or others is sinful in fact joining an organization that revels in secrecy is sinful why would you be attracted to such an organization why would you be wowed and moved by ridiculous some symbology if you want symbols look to the world around you look to the symbols inherent in your physical form look to the form of nature the form of animals trees birds look to the physical laws that God has created and what they represent these people in Freemasonry have it as their core belief that we exist in duality we do not exist in duality that is ridiculous it is a ridiculous notion to suggest that we exist in duality the only do allottee that exists is one that we've created for ourselves the only do ality that exists is exists in false creation which is not of God you look at your body look at your physical form it works you look at how you take an action to move forward in a direction and you attract good things unto yourself you attract success look at the birds and the mammals and the reptiles and the sky and the atmosphere and the water in the air water vapor and rain and lighting storms and the food chain and the plentiful abundance that is all around there is nothing dual about that a lot of people will say well you have men and women they're opposites how are they opposites how is a woman opposite to a man God created human beings and and gave them the gift of love and a way to express their law physically that way is the sex act the sex act is a beautiful act it's a beautiful expression of love there's nothing dual about it there's nothing a posts opposing about it there's nothing opposite about it it's not opposite it works together as it happens God also made homosexual souls who still can enjoy lovemaking they do it in a different way woman to woman man to man but it's still of God and when you achieve higher levels you will see that their love is just as real as the bond in the heterosexual soul and if you don't believe me that's fine but at some point you will see the truth but there's nothing opposite in this universe that God created God is a loving being God is our parent God loves us and desires our enrichment and knows that the best way that we can be enriched is by our own freewill choice God made it that way the only opposition we find is our own resistance to the truth our own desire not to act the forces that may be in any form in any capacity that you may deem holds you from greater joy greater fortune untold vistas of surprise and excitement and fascination all those forces have no power over you they have zero power over you you as a soul have agency the only power that anyone has over you is the power that you give them it's a simple idea there are people who have decided that it is best to form an organization that might provide themselves with some means of exerting a more permanent I'm looking for my word here a more permanent hold on the world and their means and methods are flawed because what is not loving is always a flawed course although they have some power it's only due to the power that human beings every man and woman in the world gives to them and they also have the power that spirits in the spirit world who have passed on whose interests remain on the earth to their own detriment I might add but they have the assistance of these dark spirits who have yet to come to the truth who have yet to desire the beautiful life-giving love of God who have yet to realize that God can be their only master they have decided to assist these wrongdoers and it is to your detriment to assume that there is no spirit world there is no life after death atheism is your only recourse it is to your detriment that you would accept such nonsense the spirit world is real spirit influence is real and it matters so that's really all I have to say in this video I hope you've enjoyed ,3

68,KfV6NPKbLqc,the plan to inject everyone on the planet with an experimental vaccine is no aberration in bill gates's envisioned decade of vaccines it is its culmination the decade of vaccines kicked off with the gates-funded 3.6 million observational study of hpv vaccines in india that according to a government investigation violated the human rights of the study participants with gross violations of consent and failed to properly report adverse events experienced by the vaccine recipients after the deaths of seven girls involved in the trial were reported a parliamentary investigation concluded that the gates-funded program for appropriate technology and health or path which ran the study had been engaged in a scheme to help ensure healthy markets for glaxosmithkline and merck the manufacturers of the gardasil and cerverix vaccines that had been so generously donated for use in the trial had path been successful in getting the hpv vaccine included in the universal immunization program of the concerned countries this would have generated windfall profit for the manufacturers by way of automatic sale year after year without any promotional or marketing expenses it is well known that once introduced into the immunization program it becomes politically impossible to stop any vaccination chandra m gulhati editor of the influential monthly index of medical specialties remarked that it is shocking to see how an american organization used surreptitious methods to establish itself in india and samarindi editor emeritus of the national medical journal of india lamented that this is an obvious case where indians were being used as guinea pigs throughout the decade india's concerns about the bill and melinda gates foundation and its corporate partners influence on the country's national immunization programs grew in 2016 the steering group of the country's national health mission blasted the government for allowing the country's national technical advisory group on immunization the primary body advising the government on all vaccination-related matters to be effectively purchased by the gates foundation as one steering group member noted the nta gi secretariat has been moved out of the government's health ministry to the office of public health foundation of india and the 32 staff members in that secretariat draw their salaries from the bill and melinda gates foundation there is a clear conflict of interest on one hand the bmgf funds the secretariat that is the highest decision-making body in vaccines and on the other it partners with the pharma industry in gavi this is unacceptable in 2017 the government responded by cutting all financial ties between the advisory group and the gates foundation similar stories play out across the gates foundation's decade of vaccines there's the gates founded and funded meningitis vaccine project which led to the creation and testing of men afrovac a 50 cent per dose immunization against meningococcal meningitis the test led to reports of between 40 and 500 children suffering seizures and convulsions and eventually becoming paralyzed there's the 2017 confirmation that the gate supported oral polio vaccine was actually responsible for the majority of new polio cases and the 2018 follow-up showing that 80 percent of polio cases are now vaccine-derived there's the 2018 paper in the international journal of environmental research and public health concluding that over 490 000 people in india developed paralysis as a result of the oral polio vaccine between 2000 and 2017. ,3

been banned on uh my main channel again for two weeks um been censored silenced all the above by this beast system it's becoming more and more uh unbearable to live in by the day that's how i know the lord jesus christ is coming to take his people very soon thank you yeshua got uh censored for a pretty heavy video that i i put up on my main page that they ended up taking down also and it's not allowing me to upload it on this channel either so that's telling me they marked the video and put something on it not be able to put it on youtube gonna have to change the format or re-record the entire thing uh in general just talking about antichrist obama mark of the beast being rolled out as we see uh false prophet everything staged events all of it so i'm coming today because this is huge um i had a dream about obama last night actually and i haven't had one as far as i know you know what i can remember from god i haven't had one of those since 2016. and that's telling me something because a lot of people like myself sears prophets whatever you want to call us um are starting to have dreams of him again and the other day i had my eyes closed and i saw a flash at him two this is telling me he's coming back to power very soon so in this dream last night um i remember i was in washington dc i believe that's where i was because i remember seeing the capitol building and i remember seeing obama speaking from a podium and this is after he already revealed himself uh that he's the antichrist i don't know how he came back to power nothing like that was shown but he was speaking to everybody and they knew who he was and most of the people that i saw were freaking out and screaming and crying because they realized how real the bible was and all of us who have been warning them about him and all of this for years uh were right and i started screaming at obama he was looking at me and i started rebuking him and telling everybody to start running that imminent destruction was coming and then i woke up that's all i remember but that's telling me something people that all of us are starting to see him again and dream him again and with everything going on in this prophetic timeline how it's all coming together all at once he's about to reveal himself very soon just a discovery i made in gematria the other day will not be able to buy travel nor sell

72,-7o3bVInA2A,the internet has been accused of wrecking many things over the years the record industry blockbuster video travel agents road maps empathy civilized debate and porno mags one thing it hasn't killed though is the conspiracy theory in fact the internet is breathing new life into some crazy ideas that have been doing the rounds for centuries [Music] well i don't know much about the movement other than i understand they like me very much how cuan and ribs of the oldest conspiracy theory in the world on the face of it q anon is a trump-era conspiracy theory it's basically an ever-expanding web of madness designed to make trump look as if he's fighting a secret global movement of evil child killers from hollywood you are unnoticed q anon is so famous now that even your grand knows about it in fact that's basically the problem your grand loves curing on and so do all her facebook friends but q anon isn't as new as you'd imagine it's basically a version of every old conspiracy theory and at its heart is a thing called the protocols of the elders of zion the most damaging conspiracy theory in history the protocols of the elders of zion is a hundred-year-old book it's a book that was read by hitler and a book that inspired the 9 11 terrorists it is perhaps the most dangerous book ever published a crazy lie that has hung over the head of every single jewish person ever since the book claims to be a real record of a secret meeting in this secret meeting powerful jewish people plot to take over the world secretly start wars manipulate banks and media and form an eternal one world government obviously this is an insane racist fantasy the protocols was proven to be a hoax in 1921 it was most likely the work of the russian empire's secret police looking to whip up support for the tsar by scapegoating a minority in this case jewish people despite the fact that the vast majority of european jews lived in abject poverty the existence of a few wealthy jewish families were spun into conspiracy theories of an insular and self-interested hebrew cabal out to control the world this is all clearly an insane lie unfortunately the world is a very racist place so plenty of people were happy to believe it when the protocols was published it was followed by a wave of violent mob riots that led to thousands of jews being killed and in america henry ford the guy who made ford cars gave away half a million copies for free more recently colonel gaddafi and hamas are among those who've used them to bolster anti-semitic resentment in the middle east and it was even the inspiration for a major egyptian tv series as recently as twenty twelve the lies of the protocol spread so widely that its central idea of a secret evil group ruling the planet is now fairly common it is the center point for many conspiracy theories especially q anon q anon gospel claims that the world is run by the families of hillary clinton who isn't jewish george soros who is and the rothschilds who are as well q says that they run the media control the banks invent wars and want to start a one world government sound familiar safer children but what about q anon's claim that these powerful people also drink the blood of children well child murder isn't directly in the protocols but it is based on a dark lie which goes hand in hand with the protocols blood libel blood libel is the ancient racist myth spread by the christian church that jewish people brutally murder christian children in order to use their blood in religious rituals and this is exactly what q and one claim the clintons in their secret society do as well except in the cue story killing children is about adrenochrome adrenochrome is a mystical chemical that q followers claim flows through children's veins that the evil elites drink to get high actual scientists have never seen massively fussed about adrenochrome but western counter culture has been mythologizing the stuff ever since aldous huxley wrote about it while off his face back in 1954. in a clockwork orange alex and his gang of sociopaths neck pints of milk laced with adrenochrome between bouts of ultra violence and in hunter s thompson's fairer loathing in las vegas the character dr gonzo claims it only works if you get it from the adrenal gland of a living human body there is conspiracies that the coronavirus is a cover-up for what is truly happening right now even over in england they say that the queen has been taking this to outstand and live a longer life and it's said to give you eternal youth during coronavirus lockdown kewanon assumed that many celebrities were looking less glam than usual because the pandemic was cutting off their supply of young blood causing them adrenochrome withdrawal do not let them normalize pedophilia [Music] people empower their subjects to fantasize about shadowy elites that don't exist that way they're not questioning the power structures that do well i don't know much about the movement other than i understand they like me very much which i appreciate you are secretly saving the world from this satanic cult of pedophiles and cannibals is that supposed to be a bad thing or a good thing i mean you know if if i can help save the world from problems i'm willing to do it i'm willing to put myself out there and we are actually some leaders are so bad so full of lies their followers have had to believe in a legion of secret pedo vampire societies in order to make their leader look like the goodie [Music] ,3
73,6B-_u8a3plE,yo what's going on guys ethan rad and i'm back with another video today we're going to be talking about the dark side of hollywood and basically what that entails for the people of hollywood and the people that rise to the huge amounts of fame so i want to talk a little bit about how fame leads to destructive actions so we've seen a lot of hollywood movie stars and people of high power who just seem to be going crazy at the moment kind of like they totally lost themselves and there's couple ideas that you sell your soul when you go big in hollywood and how basically fame leads to actions you don't really control you're getting guided every single move and you're being told what to do constantly and it's the same deal with children and children are more vulnerable in hollywood we've seen dan schneider who apparently has taken advantage of the cast of icarly sam and cat victorious he's said to have done wicked nasty things to the cast and basically controlled their actions and took advantage of them because they had very perspective roles that a lot of people wanted and he had control it's a big competition in hollywood and i think that truly makes the celebrities lose their minds slowly and slowly but it's like what can you do because in hollywood with that vast amount of competition people have to fight and people have to take the sacrifice to sell their soul and to do what they're told to gain these roles and these roles give them a lot of money and it's basically abusing powers for desires and that's what the main main higher up people in hollywood are doing and that's not the actors or the actresses it's the controllers the directors the people who are in control of the movies the tv shows and a lot of parents i've heard are forcing their children into doing this various stuff and they'll basically sell their child to hollywood to make a lot of money and they'll even sell themselves to hollywood for their child's benefit to make money and to be the next big thing which includes abuse mentally and i'm not sure about physically but truthfully we don't know and dan schneider was also talked about doing weird things and being really touchy and huggy and it's just disturbing for these young kids who are ultimately just trying to pursue their dreams but they're dealing with a lot of other you know stuff off in the distance that is kind of probably really messing them up mentally and i want to talk quickly about britney spears because she obviously is a musician so that's more the music industry and i'm also going to make a video about the music industry so look out for that in the next couple days because the music industry is honestly even worse but she's been talking about the third eye being open and how she's just really focusing on manifestation and um just mind control and it's super weird to see from her because she's obviously one of the few people who have kind of spoke out about hollywood and how she you know had the incident where she chopped off her hair and i think it really really messed her up to the point where now she's just trying to better herself and better her soul maybe she's trying to regain her soul somehow i know that sounds crazy but it really really doesn't make sense why else would she you know be so confident in this third eye scenario and along with julia roberts she was seen posting on instagram a third eye on her hand and she said world leaders we are watching you and she was also wearing an aduro mask and one of them and i'm not quite sure what she's pointing at but that's just another sign that there's some kind of world leader influence in hollywood along with the music industry and a lot of other places a lot of high up competitive jobs and professions so it it comes down to what is going on in hollywood and what can we do as a fan base to really help these people truthfully um we don't have much say um a lot of these people are fighting for these jobs fighting for these roles and it's making people lose their minds look at like people like shia labeouf um he had a more of a rough upbringing and now he is seriously devoting his life to movie roles he's getting the tattoos for the movie he's getting tattoos in the script for the movie but he's literally tattooing them permanently he's not using paint and he's going to the absolute stream of smoking cigarettes for the role i think hollywood just truthfully is changing them as people and it's corrupting their minds and it's making children vulnerable and unhappy ultimately as they get into their teens and they've realized what they've been through and how they haven't had a normal upbringing but yeah guys um i know that was kind of just a rant i want to hear you guys opinions in the comments because truthfully there's a lot more than this and it goes on and on we saw chrissy teigen make these weird tweets the other day where she was talking about children and just really disturbing stuff and we got to think like what is going on there why is hollywood obsessing over children and why are people so desperate to make these roles for people that are going to treat them negatively and just be mean to them so yeah guys comment down below explain your boy ethan rad music industry video coming out next i have some serious evidence that and it's honestly way more creepy than i think the hollywood is but i think they're both a little bit correlated but yeah you guys spend your boy with the rad i'll see you guys in the next one peace ,2
74,jbQBeHXdWgw,"hello this is Kenan again sorry about my mood yeah I've been in a kind of I don't know whatever mood in the past few days and it's stemming from a lot of different things just happening at once personal things I've gone from narcissist immed Ealing with two people threatening violence against me too but at the end of the day all these people that [ __ ] on Kenan again all day are all byproducts of Babylon and the Illuminati and these are the kind of people that I try to wake up every day but they still [ __ ] up over me worship Luciferian money Federal Reserve debt notes transsexuals yeah the article here Beyonce DNA test reveal I am descended from Illuminati bloodlines like we even need a DNA test to prove that here's a clip from a recent video I made a her [Music] and yes some of my subs had said that was probably Beyonce shape-shifting into jay-z and that was at the Super Bowl and the reason I'm bringing up the Super Bowl is because this Sunday in my City which is nothing more than the extension of Roman bread and circus keep the people fed and entertained and I'll keep a blind eye to the corruption in politics going on around them well let's talk about a few things about the football games first of all the NFL is run by Freemasons all the games are predicted in advance and it's all staged and showed just like it's as fake as WWF wrestling okay they already know who the winners are going to be they already have the championship champion ship hats and t-shirts already printed up before the game they already know secondly yes the Eagles in my city I am down the street from where everyone will be gathering if they win the game where they all gathered when the Philadelphia Phillies went to the World Series guess I can get so I probably won't be able to make any videos on Sunday because of all the noise and the police helicopters and the sirens and maybe I ought to grab my video camera out and do a fluoride test on the public because they are all worshipping these Illuminati Babylonian pieces of [ __ ] like Beyonce who is also a transsexual so yes the NFL halftime the show show this year will probably be performed by another transsexual in fact most of the women you know you know it's the same as a lot of these women out there that are dating men and I sit at home you know my cats in heat the carpets getting more action than I am right now and all these women out there who dating is suppose the tough guys are want to be bad boys and things I wonder about is how many of these women while while your boyfriends are having sex with you are secretly fantasizing about some Illuminati [ __ ] I know it sounds harsh but it's it's true and you know it's another sad reality to work on not only is your government being run by shape-shifting reptilians a lot of your women that your boyfriend's are idolizing are transsexual and a lot of the men it goes both ways this we're now finding out that there are female to male train announcer this is just too easy to undo a transvestite in do I expose her as a reptilian do I expose her as a Luciferian Saint annek transsexuals I mean she's all them so that's why I said we really needed a DNA test test but I am going to tell you a little bit about Babylon and what the Illuminati is revealing that a DNA test kit given to her by Gweneth Paltrow probably another [ __ ] thirteen-year-old daughter Apple Martin oh yeah just so happens our daughter's 13 and they named her apple yeah like the Apple in the Garden of Eden and people ask me to even though I was shown in the video that beyonce is being caught wearing quote/unquote moon bumps which are baby bumps yes you can fake pregnancy it's not that hard well they're like well how do these people have babies and well twenty years ago you know the joke was when I was growing up as a kid was always test-tube baby but um even with a modern human cloning facilities that we have now you don't need to have sex to create a new life-form it'll probably be a soulless androgynous vessel like these things coming out of Hollywood but yes I am fully aware of the Donald Marshall manifesto I've made a video on it so before people ask me about it just search through my videos I've probably done a lot of things that people ask me if I'm in tune to I'm well aware every researcher out there that talks about reptilians and the Illuminati so yes including Donald Marshall and we're gonna talk a little bit about cloning in a second because I'm beginning to believe a lot of these people like Beyonce are androgynous transsexual clones and the reason why was in the video I made about demonic possession or are calm possession being more susceptible to these soulless Babylonian piece of [ __ ] scumbag creatures that everyone is worshipping there she is right there emulating Ishtar which is the design theirs which is the divine personification of the planet Venus also known as Lucifer or the Light Bearer in Freemasonry or Freemasonry yes I say it wrong a lot a lot of people correct me on the way I say Freemasonry because personally I don't give a [ __ ] how I say I've done so much research into the freemason they I despise them so much I can care less if I'm pronouncing their name wrong or right I'm one of the few people walking around and knows about the ride to goat ritual where they have to ask for hard or soft butter in front of a hard or soft butter wet their goat meat right to a Master Mason yeah it's a sodomite ritual it's disgusting it's getting freemason about the ride to goat ritual the lights right to your face about it but guess what I don't lie and I'm tired of people [ __ ] on me because I'm exposing Babylon everywhere from people in my personal life to narcissists to the trolls in the comments yeah I refuse to worship Lucifer and pamper to Babylon so if you want to hate me for it or you want to threaten violence against me death you want to punish me what Luciferian money by D monetizing my videos like YouTube does you know it's ironic is that the [ __ ] Bowl this year during the halftime show you're gonna have scumbag corporations pay millions of dollars to put embedded Illuminati symbolism into the commercials right in front of your face on national TV why YouTube deep monetizes all my videos exposing pedophilia and baby blood harvesting so that's what I think about Babylon and their Luciferian money and their debt notes how do you think the Illuminati stays in power word that society and when you deal in their debt currency you more or less owe your soul to Babylon and they will be sure of it whether through car payments your mortgage taxes they will tax us to death and paying for utilities we live on a planet that's 70% water and yeah everyone's paying for water Nikola Tesla was going to give the whole entire planet free electricity yet we're paying for electricity yeah it's because they keep us in debt they want you to be a good little slave worshipping their Babylonian Beyonce [ __ ] during the Superbowl killing each other over debt money if you're a bad boy out there selling drugs I hate to inform you but your employer is the CIA or the cocaine importation agency what do you think your cocaine and heroin comes from that your comes from the daddy bush crime family and it's already been exposed with the cue on anon revelations so if you're a drug dealer out there you work for daddy bush and if you're in a federal prison right now you're a for-profit commodity to companies like Halliburton who put you in prison because you're worth $48,000 a year so when you get caught selling the CIA's drugs and they throw you in prison for a profit so they make money off you either way and that's how the Illuminati rolls and every generation that's getting worse and worse but anyway she is declaring in this article I'm not gonna read too much of it that she has found out that she is related to the Rockefellers on my mom's side I thought something from not the distant cousins of the British royal family well another thing I want to say does anyone ever remember because I'll make a video on it when Obama went to Egypt and saw a bust of a pharaoh that looked exactly like he did I put that in my Donald Marshall cloning video because there's been a lot of high-profile celebrities that have been seen throughout the ages supposedly having doppelgangers or people that look like them from over a hundred years ago showing with photographs and all this and it's my belief that quote unquote nothing new Under the Sun these are your same Babylonian recycled reptilian [ __ ] over and over again just playing different parts in society because they are nothing more than pagan actors and just like I showed with the pagan acting in Rome all parts are played by men so all your pop stars all your Hollywood celebrities is it no coincidence that we're finding out how many [ __ ] are affecting Hollywood or how many reptilians are affecting Hollywood or Babylon as I call it it's no surprise and yet I'm tired of people who pander to Babylon and Luciferian values [ __ ] all over me all the time when I'm sitting here getting demonetised on YouTube thankfully getting by with donations when people help me out I'm sitting there eating tuna fish and ramen noodles for lunch and scumbag Luciferian corporations are putting in our highest bids for the Super Bowl commercials on who's going to be able to from multi-million dollar ads with embedded Illuminati and New World Order symbolism during the [ __ ] halftime show being watched by millions when it's a Super Bowl that the the final score has already been set up and predicted and scripted by the freemason and this and it's gonna be acted out yeah you know you don't think they manipulate all the gambling that's directly connected to organized crime [ __ ] it's all a show to keep you distracted so yeah Beyonce revealing that I am descended from Illuminati bloodlines what that means is you're a [ __ ] of Babylon and you are emitting it so yeah let's not sugarcoat anything Beyonce I'm sure in the relationship with you and jay-z he's probably the bottom you're probably the top oh and another black drama queen comes to my I made a video about who was Illuminati priest that is Oprah Winfrey there's been a lot of people making videos on why Oprah Winfrey has no chance or shouldn't be president but let me point out the obvious what so I'm surprised no one didn't point out what's I should have pointed out the other video Oprah is not married so she cannot become president one of the requirements to become president in the United States is usually that you are married I mean even Hillary Clinton was supposedly married to don't Clinton yeah what a joke that is that marriage em but technically on paper yes they still are married it would have made him the first man of the White House but I think I think we can give that honor to Michelle Obama or Michael Obama actually she was the first man of the white house were probably a few more before her that we were unaware of so but unless Oprah's gonna go out there and get herself a [ __ ] husband or even a lesbian wife you know Ellen DeGeneres probably has a better chance to become president and she does because Ellen is married to a lesbian so but yeah and until she gets married she has no shot at even running because I'm surprised no one's even brought that up yet I guess the sheep were asleep huh they just heard Oprah wants to be President and didn't even think that she wasn't married and I mean I don't know how that was gonna work so anyway there is the writer put 13 things that the Illuminati aren't in control of in the description I think people I've touched on a lot of these points in the rant I just made which is what it did that yes they control everything they are [ __ ] all over human civilization and hopefully Babylon comes to an end and I will do everything in my power to help take them out but I warn you if you want to take the route like I did in life and take down Babylon it's not going to be pretty at the expense of personal relationships everything you're just going to be [ __ ] on by Luciferian and narcissists and sadly it makes up a large amount of the population on earth right now or at least in the United States it's not a fun road but I refuse to serve Babylon or cater to any of its inhabitants anymore I'm sick of Babylon so anyway this link will be in a description if there's any questions or comments leave them below and until we speak again this is canon again and take care ",2
75,f0eIMUHictw,alright guys this video is specifically about seeking the truth I found lots and lots of pictures of Earth on the internet videos we all learned it learned about earth in school the globe round shaped planet spins on axis but what is the real truth what is the real truth about the planet about the moon about the galaxy have we ever been outside of the galaxy to look down on the Milky Way how do we know what it looks like are we just programmed from school do we only believe what they want us to believe when a rocket takes off does it go straight up does it leave the atmosphere in a vertical position I don't think so things aren't always as they seem to be so that's why I'm continuing to search for the truth continuing I'm sorry see footage of Rockets taken off footage from earth outward-facing footage from the rocket ship but what happens when I gets to space where is this footage of it leaving the atmosphere so hard to find guys just tell me what you think I've been looking for consistency in these pictures and videos and it doesn't seem to be any do you think we've been to the moon the International Space Station seems to look like a satellite and how come there's no stars there's no stars in space when I looked up I seem to see stars what do you think about that how come there's no stars in space or in any picture with the astronaut on the moon can't seem to find any stars let me know down below in the comments what you think I don't want to just form my own opinion I like to keep an open mind for others opinion let me know please like subscribe feel free to comment we'll be responding to your comments if you would like so you just ask for a response or an answer alright stay tuned for more videos please smash that subscribe button ,3
76,2zil2GTcPEw,what's up people GM skywatcher here it is still Saturday November 23rd it's about 1 p.m. it's only been a few hours first video was about 8 a.m. I made 2 other videos this is my third video so in just 5 hours they have completely saturated our skies in chemicals and heavy metals I mean just look around you know all you have to do is look up and pay attention you can see this happening I mean people still doubt this they doubt that our weather is controlled that it's absolutely manufactured I mean just take a look around because this looked like a natural sky do you see clouds no this is a chemical backdrop you know you may see some cows some clouds flying between the surface of the earth and that chemical backdrop but this thing this is not normal this is created by man they have owned our weather for some time now they are perfecting it you know these clowns on TV you know they purposely get the weather wrong they know I mean when they talk about these storm systems coming in I mean are you kidding me this is being created if you have doubts look at any of my videos but specifically look at today's two videos and then I mean you can see the whole process people our weather has been hijacked [Music] wake up to this sad reality and spread the word [Music] ,2
77,k4-rs5JiqqA,ladies and gentlemen warning on 5g from your friendly neighborhood tower climber they are not testing the biologic results hazards of this new technology the effects on the populace on you and me the effects of this small cell technology being installed on our street corners and billboards and in the restaurants and office complexes where we work the health effects are not being tested i just watched a video this morning on the big tech giants testifying in front of the senate there's no additional research going in the reason nobody knows if this is dangerous or not is because they are not testing it now here's what we do know radio frequency is harmful to humans especially at close range the closer it gets the more dangerous it gets here's something else we know the sec rulings on the safety levels of radio frequency off towers has not been changed since the mid 90s here's something else we know there is an fcc rule on the books that keeps them from putting this new technology that close to your home and they are actively trying to change it ladies and gentlemen now's the time if we're going to speak out speak up and educate ourselves before this happens now is the time i've had calls to quit my job and protest and leave this career that i love that does nobody any good me educating myself [Music] and disseminating that information that helps and that's what i'm going to continue to do i'm going to continue to work on the e911 systems that let our first responders help people in need i'm going to continue to climb these towers and bring the internet to the remote countryside i'm not going to install small cells in front of your homes i am going to speak out god bless you god bless america ,2
78,1Jg92tgN_l8,hey everyone i just wanted to say good morning and i hope everybody has a good day today and we all need to really um turn to the lord jesus christ with all our heart body mind soul and strength and trust in him and only trust in the father with all of our being because we are in very dangerous and deadly times i just wanted to also mention um the really the really diabolical truth of 5g and i'm not trying to freak people out but i have to speak about it because it's just something that we're supposed to do we're supposed to expose the evil that we are told and so on but um so the 5g system plan and well its capabilities and its plans are to literally destroy your spirit man um it literally breaks down your spirit spirit man your spiritual barriers your spiritual boundaries and all aspects of your of the spiritual being within you and this is exactly what their ipec go to movie was about is about to destroy the abraham exceed the christ within you and unfortunately most of the people who have tried to interpret it have falsely interpreted because they think it means um the destruction of america because it shows a five dollar bill with abraham lincoln on it not realizing that the truth of it is to destroy the abrahamic seed christ in you anyway we need to excuse me my throat is so dry but um we need to fight against these weapons the father well jesus had given us his literal power and authority over all forces of darkness so we need to pray against these things and dismantle them we have the power and authority to do so anyway i love all you all of you in christ and stay strong and turn to the father immediately bye ,2
79,X-oJNOFUujo,do they think we're idiots look at that plain as can be there's no hiding from bill okay we're going to do a little experiment vikra if you'll follow me up here what i have here as everyone knows leaves protect from 5g radiation so i'm just going to shield myself i can feel that in my back of my neck i'm just going to and we're going to leave two eggs here two full eggs not boiled not anything we're just gonna leave them there and we're gonna come back to that ah can you feel that it's about three minutes now i've left those two eggs there as you can remember let's have a look oh it's very hot i'm nearly afraid to touch it but that i can feel already look at that how did that happen ,2
80,9M7oLxDmaek,cam here watchmen news 1776. today's topic the 5g hotel you can check out any time you like but you can't ever leave the one thing that all 5gs have in common is that it affects the lungs causing respiratory flu-like symptoms and here's the shocker they were all referred to as an associated coronavirus 1g was launched in 1987 the fake news announced that the bird flu had broken out 2g was launched in 2003 fake news announced sars virus had broken out 3g was launched in 2009 fake news announced the swine flu or h1n1 had broken out 4g was launched in 2012 fake news announced that the kamiflu or mers had broken out 5g was launched in 2019 and the fake news media announced that the corona virus better known as covet 19 had broken out things that make you go hmm ,2
81,vhYoEAAYi1w,good evening my name is rudy giuliani and i'm the former mayor of new york city in 2013 my city elected a self-described progressive democrat as mayor new york city once described as america's crime capital had become by the mid 1990s america's safest large city now today my city is in shock murders shootings and violent crime are increasing at percentages unheard of in the past we're seeing the return of rioting and looting during riots this democrat mayor like others has often prevented the police from making arrests and even when arrests are made liberal progressive das released the rioters so as not to disrupt the rioting new yorkers wonder how did we get overwhelmed by crime so quickly and declined so fast don't let democrats do to america what they have done to new york again the democrats are urging you to vote for an obviously defective candidate biden has changed his principles so often he no longer has any principles he's a trojan horse with bernie aoc pelosi black lives matter and his party's entire left wing just waiting to execute their pro-criminal anti-police socialist policies the whole unprecedented wave of lawlessness began with a truly just cause the unforgivable police killing of george floyd in minneapolis peaceful protests began all over the land the condemnation of the killing was universal from president trump to democrat leaders it seemed for a few brief shining moments democrat and republican leaders would come together with a unified proposal to reduce police misconduct this possibility was very dangerous to the left they had a president to beat and a country to destroy and although an agreement on action against police brutality would be very valuable for the country it would also make president trump appear to be an effective leader they could have none of that so black lives matter and antiva sprang into action and in a flash they hijacked the peaceful protest into vicious brutal riots soon protests turned into riots in many other american cities almost all democrat businesses were burned and crushed people beaten shot and killed police officers routinely assaulted badly beaten and occasionally murdered and the police handcuffed by progressive democrat mayors from doing anything but observe the crimes and absorb the blows but the worst of it was the slaughter of innocent young people with their whole lives ahead of them the murder of four-year-old grand tal pharaoh in kansas city shocked the nation but not black lives matter or their many democrat supporters year old basketball star brandon hendricks was killed in the bronx just days after graduating high school and on his way to st john's to play basketball he passed with only a brief mention one-year-old david gardner jr was shot and killed in a stroller at a cookout in brooklyn and it caused no outrage for president trump and for us republicans all black lives matter and the lives of legrand and brandon devil matter to us all lives matter to us these continuous riots in democratic cities gives you a good view of the future under biden all five of the top cities for homicides like the top cities for rioting and looting are governed by progressive democrats using the progressive democrat approach to crime which is to do nothing substantive to reduce it to release prisoners as many and as soon as possible and to go to war with the police the only group with the capability to protect your citizens it is clear that a vote for biden and the democrats creates the risk that you will bring this lawlessness to your city to your town to your suburb there is no question that this awesome job of restoring safety for our people cannot be done from your basement joe there's also no question that president trump will fight with all his strengths to preserve the american system of government and our way of life in critical times in our history america has always been blessed with the right person to handle the crisis washington lincoln roosevelt reagan were perfect for the challenges they faced and brought our nation through gloriously president trump with his boundless love of our country and all our people his disciplined work ethic his exceptional ability to inspire and his deep understanding of our system of government and the strength of american values is the man we can trust to preserve and even improve our way of life mr president make our nation safe again ,3
82,K2S75Xrqncw,hello freak [ __ ] he has a good time debunking things but he has an official story mentality is what I would call it where no matter what like there's people that are objective and there's people that are deep bunkers and he's a deep bunker and it doesn't necessarily mean he's wrong about a lot of stuff but it does mean that he goes into things with the intention to debunk and the intention to almost always gravitate towards an official tourist yeah every single day he acted alone yeah that's a goof come on man that one's goofy he believes tower 7 collapsed at freefall speed because of fires there's a lot of people who believe that unfortunately I'm not a [ __ ] engineer I would like to know know whether or not it's possible to burn a building so bad inside that it does collapse like that it's impossible I don't know if that's true it's no it's it all you have to do is talk to engineers and architects I've talked to them you could you cried there's no there's no architects that outside of NIST a government agency there's no architects fighting for to debunk the tower 7 there's none and every true you I don't know if you know that there's like but are there's got to be some architects and engineers that don't think that that building fell because it was demolished look no well if you understand how it's there's about a hundred thousand architects and engineers and the associations like the American Association of Architects in here there's about a hundred thousand and Richard gage he's one of them and he didn't know anything about he thought it was a it wasn't an inside job it took him years and then he didn't really know about tower 7 most of them don't know about Tower 7 what he does now he discovered it and what he does now is just go from convention to convention sitting 15 architects down at a time and boom about 99% of them they all believe it though they didn't even know there was a third tower it was not in the media that much they basically I think that's crazy I think by this time everybody knows about tower cellar they still don't know most people think no they don't you they don't have a ladder on the mainstream media anybody people have talked about it enough online to the point more than ever but now more than ever yes they go to hear about that Tower 7 thing but they don't really know the details they just kind of just know about it you know did you ever see the video that shows the full collapse which takes a lot longer you see the first collapse it was the top of the thing falls into the center and that's the elevations yeah they explain architects and engineers I've sat with them I'm no structural engineer but you tell the comedy this is what if someone told you if someone told you there's 85 columns that hold up Tower 7 mm-hmm and if someone told you of a structural engineer told you would you think he was crazy or would you believe him if he said and it makes sense I mean it's common sense the only way you're gonna get a building to come down like that any building any structure is you have to blow up all 80 comps at the same time otherwise it won't go down like that to me that's common sense to someone who believes this the government agency said no that's not true one column went and then it spiraled out of control because of fires when you talk to structural engineers I've had Richard gage on my podcast twice every time it comes back he gets more he just piles on more because all I gotta do is sit him down they don't know nobody knows that's the truth see as he ever it debated someone who's like an opposing viewpoint look into it it's common sense anybody knows you so you think that they know that it's not true they think they think that power tower 7 was an inside job they don't want to debate it because they can't win do you really think they think that I say that again so you think the people that are debunking it so like if he's got this opinion there's no our architects and engineers debunking it that's already looked into that that's already been lately that's already been young inside that's gotta be a Texan engineers just disagree mm-hmm come on man you don't think there's any people do find a video of a real Jamie see if you can but doesn't that make sense an engineer told you a struck a dude who build skyscrapers told you to your face like I and told to my face they said the only way that thing and you see it on video engineer after engineer after engineer are they all crazy the engineer engineer after engine it's impossible when you look into it it's impossible for a building to collapse like that unless all 80 columns are blown up at the same time we've covered this but here's the I don't know anything about engineering I don't know if you have diesel fires that get out of control if it weakens the entire structure where it just collapses like that you have you have guests all the time there are experts in fields that you're not experts in but when you sit here find out sometimes they're wrong about some stuff and then they find out that they're making some of it up or this but an engineer a guy who builds understand this right doesn't it make sense does that make sense Google like try to figure out like who resists architects and engineers like what is it I'm reading right now an article from The Boston Globe that talks about truthers and 9/11 and Richard gages talked about I think they might have interviewed Inman and I'm trying to figure out what they're talking about there's got to be some engineers that have had a conversation or debate okay maybe they're out there I don't know [ __ ] I don't know how my [ __ ] computer works I don't know do you know anything that constructs anything you know a lot of [ __ ] you know but if somebody wanted to argue with me about the components and how they worked on a laptop I would have to let go I you're probably right I have to talk to some computer engineer who's gonna tell me the actual reality of it I've talked about it want build buildings I've had a mom I'm sure but I just can't believe all the people that build buildings think it's an inside job so okay what percent okay what if nine would be pretty impressive if 90 percent that we pretty impressive it was a 50 that would be impressive exactly it's 50 percent would be impressed it's about in the 90s I don't know if that's right so I don't know where you get in that number I'm getting it from Richard gage who's the head of architects and engineers 9/11 truth right they add another couple I understand but you know but he might be a little biased right I mean if he's the head of architects and engineers from 9/11 truth and he tells you that 90 percent of the architects and engineers out there think it's an inside job it might be a little biased I don't know if that's true and I don't think you do necessarily either I think we're just guessing I believe it to see I would love to see an architect or an engineer that disagreed with him talk to him about it and go over the data because until that happens I don't know what the [ __ ] they're talking about no nobody argues with them nobody does that's gotta be there's got to be someone who debunks that guy everybody debunks everybody no they definitely a smear campaign are you kidding smear campaign or is it just that they're saying things that he's saying that aren't correct it's not just him he's just saying he's one of many it's common sense dude maybe okay it's just right but I don't know I don't know anything about making buildings I don't know anything about what it takes for a building to collapse I don't know totally I don't know anything maybe it got hot but it's not just hot it's shanks of guns that were in the basement I want to believe that I want to believe that fires made it hot I don't want to believe they blew it up because that's [ __ ] that's scary I want I want to believe the fire if a fire is in a basement and the fire has diesel fuel and it's burning at some insane temperature and this [ __ ] [ __ ] loads of diesel fuel down there I wonder what effect that has I don't know do you I'm pretty sure based on my life's experience that that's not gonna bring down a building fuel life it's based on common sense it's common sense that yeah if a building the building's gonna fall at free spot fall speed boom like that if a engineer after engineer after engineer at some point I'm gonna believe them at some point I'm not gonna understand any but I don't I don't know if you've necessarily looked into the engineers at disagree I know I know there's a smear campaign there okay but have you looked into the engineers there's none there's nothing there's no there's no documentary it's kinda there's no documentary find a documentary a documentary for it to make sense what was that what if it's an article what if it's a peer review paper what if it's some sort of those are all dude that's a smear camp there's that side there's the elites they don't want this out and then there's people trying to get the truth out so the elite have the control of the media so how are you gonna they have paid shills on you don't think you think did they drop they would have dropped the ball big time like Ernest Byner 1987 for the brows they would have dropped the ball if you're not if you don't have paid shills online strategically pushing the agenda come on there's a bunch of fake [ __ ] on richard gage thing that i was trying to debunk see if anybody's debunking him I'm looking around I'm just looking around the Boston Globe article says that there's a small vocal subset of people of Engineers that are with this Richard gage that's what I read I never read that it was like some overwhelming number just keep keep stirring it's it's hard because it's fun it's exciting it's exciting to think that there's some sort of a gigantic ball of super geniuses that run the world and they decided to blow up Tower seven you know what's funny about the moon [ __ ] is the hardest [ __ ] ever accomplished the greatest by the human race the greatest accomplishment ever was landing on the moon right right so you would think holy [ __ ] I don't think it does know what listen okay okay but let's just at the time at the time know Internet is the biggest okay okay but I'm just talking about like a physical achievement three dudes they got shot up in a rocket they were in a like a orbiter and then the orbiter shot out the lunar like the LEM and then it lands they played golf went doom bug riding the donuts in the sand they get take pictures they get back in take-off dock with that orbiter and then fly back that's the hardest [ __ ] ever no one died yeah can you imagine can you imagine that second mission six months later they did it again when when they had to break the news that they were gonna use different astronauts because every mission they use different astronauts what didn't you think they would like a show like I have the same star over no no the three dudes have pulled it off keep doing it they do know you're kidding they did it before yeah but they don't wanna keep doing it what if they were planning on using Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong but they just [ __ ] got egos and [ __ ] they start going to clubs to the moon for like you know seventy thousand dollars they've got that government check she won the second album or on the second it just like the record business you know what I mean we make that much babe of course I say listen we'll get you on that second on the second and third land you gonna be famous you're gonna be [ __ ] doing all sorts of press think about the [ __ ] think about the coke they probably got blowed out and got too cocky and wanted to renegotiate oh my god and then NASA said we just got to go with some new dudes they made $8 per diem when Uncle Sam [ __ ] you raw dog he uses sand Uncle Sam used this broken class on his dick that dude was hovering in an orbiter he was hovering in an orbiter and they landed some little piece-of-shit lunar lander would delay and then they took and they show the only time ever they got one shot of it taking off and whatever was filming it followed it all the way up yeah like who was no no there was a live remote control that's it they said that they could control from far from Houston and for sure that works the moon landings are so got down ridiculous Oh [ __ ] there's video of them like just maybe a hundred thousand feet in the air and they're like filming it making it look you know they're manipulating what the [ __ ] come on that video stream that's the damming I've never seen anybody [Applause] [Music] [Applause] ,2
83,1MzxFwglO10,welcome everyone to our live webinar 911 an architect's guide a three-part series i'm richard gage aia member of the american institute of architects and founder of architects and engineers for 9 11 truth we're a 501 c 3 non-profit organization representing a growing body of now more than 3 400 architects and engineers signed on to the petition demanding a new investigation into the destruction of all three world trade center skyscrapers on 911. this is part three last week we looked at part two in this three-part series this is the twin towers and extreme heat today in which we'll be looking at the evidence of very high temperatures and incendiary chemical reactions involved in the destruction of these two skyscrapers before we go further though let me introduce you to our operations manager and the host of 911 free fall mr andy steele hello andy hello richard hello everybody thank you for tuning in today as always i just want to let everyone know i am here to help with any technical glitches which will occur from time to time also we'll be happy to take your questions at the end of the webinar today best way to submit them is go to ae911truth.org go to continuing education at the top and select the live webinars you'll see a box you can type them right in there i'll also be looking at our facebook page the broadcast of this there and on youtube for any good comments or questions related to the material that richard will be presenting here today so with all that said back to you richard thanks andy and just so people have an idea of what uh i've been up to and my background i was responsible at a local firm here in the san francisco bay area for the construction documents for these three and 10 million dollar gymnasiums and the construction administration for this 125 million dollar high school and also before more recently before launching full-time into this important outreach effort i had similar responsibilities working on this mixed-use 400 million dollar project near las vegas with six blocks of retail mid-rise office space and parking structure all together about 1200 tons of fireproofed steel framing i now work full time educating architects engineers and others to understand what really happened at the world trade center using the material in these courses so with that said let's jump right into it here we go the scientific method just a quick review because we've had it in the west for almost 500 years now depending on how you count it up we have a question what brought the towers down in this case right we do some background research how have other towers come down we make some observations we construct a hypothesis that's our best guess as to how the towers came down we don't focus in on one hypothesis or another based on our personal and financial obligations that might sway our objective opinion in the matter is to determine how the towers came down maybe they came down by jet planes fires or perhaps it was explosions maybe maybe even controlled demolition we'll be looking at lots of evidence for that today we test these hypotheses with experiments we analyze the results we draw conclusions if the hypothesis is corroborated we report the results in an open transparent manner so all can build on the body of the work that we're doing we don't hide in a black box the computer input data as nist has done for example if the hypothesis is not corroborated we go back and we construct a new hypothesis that's what we're about today until we find one that is corroborated by the experiments the observations the research the data and so forth so let's begin with doing some background research looking at forces which have destroyed buildings fire's certainly one of them it's an organic chaotic process that moves through a building every 20 minutes burning up a given area and moving on to a fresh new uh set of fuel sources even nist acknowledges interestingly that what what fire protection engineers have acknowledged for decades the fires don't persist in any one location in modern office buildings for more than about 20 or 30 minutes they move on looking for fresh new fuel sources and we'll see how that conflicts or we saw last week how that conflicts with their own theory of how the towers came down and how severe and long-standing those fires were um and if you missed last week's part two in this three-part series i encourage you to look it up on youtube it's free and you'll find uh 911 an architect's guide part two the twin towers explosive destruction so skyscrapers we haven't lost one for a long time uh steel frame fireproof skyscrapers but say wood frame buildings we'd expect since the structure itself is flammable um if it did catch on fire uh and it was not properly fireproof we'd expect it to fall in stages uh over to the path of least resistance not straight down through the greatest path of resistance the thousands of tons of structure that might be beneath the fire for instance in a in a taller building but that's the reason we don't build skyscrapers out of wood we build them out of steel so we look for a precedent for steel frame skyscrapers that uh what might happen in a severe fire like this one that they built where they built an eight-story building uh in order to try to burn it down and they still couldn't uh yes uh even with as you see here uh not not fire proofed in in some of the beams and columns and uh and others had fireproofing well they built they tried to get as hot uh office fire as they possibly could as you can tell by all of the fuel that they loaded up into this poor building uh and uh and here's what they found oops we actually looked at that last week and what they what they did find is that the steel beams can sag as you see here the columns uh in this case fireproofed and these steel beams are not fireproofed what they found oh let's see if we can yeah we we do have it here it is this was the largest test of its kind ever conducted it showed how unprotected steel can be distorted even by a normal office fire but as is typical in steel buildings the structural beams only slowly and progressively warped and sagged there was no chance of a sudden collapse in over 20 years i have not seen until recently a protected steel structure that has collapsed in a fire until recently of course he's referring here to 911 at the world trade center when we had not two but three protected steel structures collapse due to fire well the study itself cites the inherent stable behavior of steel frame construction due to the highly redundant nature of the form so that's pretty pretty amazing also amazing is that the connections themselves don't even fail and we saw that the failure of the connections was the worst problem that nist claimed to be true in the case of building seven in part one of this three-part series well let's look at some buildings that were destroyed by natural causes in this case earthquakes these buildings they fell over uh to the path of least resistance the aftermath yields a building that is recognizable as such it's it's not a an incomprehensible mixture of pieces of the building like we'll see well like we saw last week in part two the columns and the beams are not severed one from another so keep this in mind uh as we proceed here these buildings were blown up we have thick billowing enormous pyroclastic-like clouds that are expanding rapidly in cauliflower-shaped form due to the incredible heat from the chemical reactions in the explosives we have witnesses that hear sounds of explosions they see flashes of light we looked at those last week this week we will be focusing on the pyroclastic-like clouds here and of course explosions can be harnessed quite effectively to bring down tall buildings as you see in this series of controlled demolitions like the old hotels in las vegas for instance which we're all familiar with they set these charges at precise locations within the building and and uh synchronistically set them off floor by floor usually starting at the bottom and working their way up but they don't have to do that as you'll see so the result of a controlled demolition is a set of very recognizable features at least in a typical controlled demolition we'd we'd expect to see a sudden onset of destruction we'd expect to see a straight down or nearly symmetrical collapse into the building's footprint a patterned removal of column supports is how that is achieved we have a near free-fall acceleration straight down into the path of what was the greatest resistance the structure the thousands of tons of structure below we have the total dismemberment of the structural steel frame we have limited damage to adjacent structures that's certainly one of the goals of controlled demolition explosions and flashes of light heard and seen by witnesses we looked at that last week we have broken up concrete floors uh you don't want to have to go back and do that work manually when the explosives could do that work it would be very dangerous work in a post controlled demolition with floors at all odd angles and so forth explosive charges are visible at various floors yeah those are explosives i mean it's obvious what else can they be uh we'll be looking at quite a bit of that today as actually we we looked at those last week in part two today we'll be focusing on uh chemical evidence of explosive devices um this is direct evidence of destruction with explosives these features uh not any of these features um are associated with destruction by fire let alone all of them so if we have these features we know we have explosive demolition fires cause structures to collapse asymmetrically with gradual deformations following the path of least resistance so we have a set of fires in this country and other countries which are fine examples of the resistance uh um of these buildings to the fires let's take a look may 4th 1988 the first interstate bank a 62-storey building in los angeles california suffered a three and a half hour fire which burned across five floors and moved an estimated 200 million dollars of damage it did not collapse february 23 1991 the one meridian plaza a 38-story building in philadelphia suffered an 18-hour fire which burned across eight floors the fire caused an estimated 100 million dollars worth of damage and three firefighters died fighting it it was later described by officials as the most significant fire of the century it did not collapse october 17 2004 the east tower of the park central complex in caracas venezuela suffered a 17-hour fire which spread across 26 of its 56 floors it did not collapse august 18 2007 a fire broke out on the 17th floor of the deutsche bank building in new york a building undergoing deconstruction after being heavily damaged by debris from the south tower on originally 41 stories in height it had been reduced to 26 at the time of the fire which lasted seven hours and affected a total of ten floors two firefighters died of smoke inhalation it did not collapse on 911 itself five world trade center a nine-story building east of the north tower was engulfed in flames after sustaining heavy damage from falling debris a number of partial collapses occurred but the overall structure remained standing february 9 2009 the mandarin oriental hotel in beijing was completely engulfed in flames for more than three hours during the lunar new year celebrations the fire affected all 44 floors igniting fireworks as it burned one firefighter died fighting it it did not collapse no they it didn't and and if any of the world trade center buildings were to collapse due to fire you'd expect it to be this one which is fully engulfed world trade center five did it collapse no mid-rise high-rise fireproof buildings do not collapse uh and steel frame buildings and um nor did these uh after 9 11 fully engulfed fires so the only high rises that have collapsed in this category are the world trade center fibers high rises with these fires which are diminished as you can see at before the time of the collapse a thick black smoke indicating oxygen starved cooler fires so keep this in mind now why have we not lost a skyscraper due to an uncontrolled fire ever well steel frame conducts that heat away the steel is quite dense so this the source of the heat never gets to its 1200 degree temperature at which time steel can give way and lose half of its strength at the 1200 degrees fahrenheit so we keep that from happening by coating our steel beams and columns with fireproofing cementitious fireproofing which is what makes it last two hours in a fire or three hours four to six times as long and longer than it needs to be because fire only lasts 20 minutes in a given area as you saw earlier so this is quite sufficient but we also keep the tenants from bringing in materials that are that constitute heavy fire loads and we keep the contractors from building these material these buildings out of flammable structure and so forth and just to keep all that from happening we've put sprinklers in these buildings and those sprinklers in the world trade center were said to have been damaged by the airplanes apparently i mean according to the official story so they they weren't much help but with additional circumstantial and corroborative testimony government documentation you have to have approvals to bring down a building um people so people know in advance there's four knowledge of the destruction as we saw in the case of building seven in part one of this three-part series experts agree yeah that's a controlled demolition well at least those experts without financial or political obligations that might sway their objective opinion in the matter and video documentation all this can be proof of controlled demolition a body of proof that we're now going to apply to the world trade center towers now we started last week in part two of this series with a sudden onset of destruction we saw there was patterned explosions and flashes of light we saw a straight down destruction symmetrical destruction of the building and the ejection of building materials at lower floors uh at 70 and 80 miles an hour laterally out of the building and uh we saw a near free-fall acceleration as clocked by physicists indicating that the building uh that structure had to have been removed prior to the load hitting the building from above not hitting but um crushing so we saw the total shattering of the structural steel frame indicating from national fire protection guide 921 the fire and explosion investigation that this is evidence of explosiveness explosive destruction we saw the lateral ejection of the structural steel 600 feet out we saw the pulverized concrete already so this was all destruction direct evidence of destruction with explosives that we were looking at last week and fire doesn't create these features uh any of them let alone all of them today we're going to be looking and focusing in on the pyroclastic-like clouds uh in other words the heat again the nfpa 921 says look for thermal effects okay what does that mean actually well the large volume of gas and the large amount of heat released in chemical explosions causing rapidly expanding plumes of hot gases like we see emitted from all from all sides of the world trade center towers in all the videos cauliflower shaped expanding rapidly in fact 10 times the volume of the building in just 30 seconds indicating extremely rapid expansion by heat now this is a lot more heat expanding than we would have had in the fires which surely were extinguished on those floors by the mechanical action of the collapsing tower so we're looking for a whole lot more heat than these few small remaining fires at the time of the collapse again which were surely extinguished we're looking for heat on the order of something like this and we find it as we go looking for the source and the evidence of that heat let's start with massimo mazuco's 911 new pearl harbor possibly the most important unexplained phenomenon at ground zero are the extremely high temperatures registered under the rubble for many weeks after the collapses on september 16th nasa shot these thermographic images of ground zero indicating unusually high temperatures at the base of the three collapsed buildings despite the heavy rains of september 14th the hot spots registered peak temperatures of more than 1300 degrees under the rubble ten days later the fires kept burning what's to explain governor the smoke that still comes out there's still there's still fire down below there is such an incredibly deep pile of rubble and then the tower goes down five six stories underground we had uh abc uh crews come back just in the last few minutes and telling us there are still flames coming out of the base of the trade towers for the rescue workers this became an additional burden on their already gruesome task out still on the rubble it's still uh i believe about 1100 degrees the guy's boots just melt within a few hours on october 8th the hot spots under the three collapsed buildings remained clearly visible six weeks later as the excavations progressed the situation seemed only to get worse oh it's unbelievable and this is six weeks later almost six weeks later and as we get closer to the center of this it gets hotter and hotter it's probably 1500 degrees we've had some small windows into um what we thought was the board at some point and it looked like a uh an oven you know it was just worn inside it's just a bright bright reddish orange color the consequences of such extreme temperatures were quite visible on the steel that was being extracted from the rubble the grapplers were pulling stuff out big sections of iron that were literally on fire on the other end they would hit the air and burst into flames which was uh pretty spooky to say he would create an air pocket by moving steel fueling the fight on the ground but you know these underground fires were just like to fire to help if you could make a video of what you perceive hell to look like from fire shooting up at times that's what would happen you would be in the middle of what looked like steel and then fire this would pop up firemen were coming out with an ironworker their boots literally melted and then the hose would come over and they would try to put that part out i got there charlie richards was a supervisor of removal operations at ground zero from pbs's america rebuilds page we read victor's crew picked up 40 to 60 foot long pieces of steel impaled in the pile where the bottom 20 feet would be glowing red hot vicher said trucks loaded with steel would pass by and you could feel the back of your neck burning standing 20 feet away in an article called a dangerous work site the us department of labor wrote underground fires burned at temperatures of 2000 degrees fahrenheit this was confirmed by mayor giuliani there were fires of 2 000 degrees fahrenheit below the ground the journal of the american society of safety engineers wrote thermal measurements taken by helicopter each day showed underground temperatures ranging from 400 to more than 2800 degrees fahrenheit eight weeks later and the fires still had not subsided you see how this debris is still smoking that's when the fire is going to start burning eight weeks later we still got fires burned i mean these things are burning at one point i think they were about 2800 degrees 11 weeks later and the fires kept burning as recently as the end of november it was still 1100 degrees down underneath the rubble as november turned into december ice was noticed in the mornings above the ground but the debris underneath was still smoldering the weird thing was it was very cold when we were up there i believe it was it was in the middle of the winter but the ground wasn't frozen the ground kind of like bubbled underneath your feet which was kind of strange to me it took until december 19 more than three months after the collapses for the last underground fire to be extinguished in fact structural engineers at the site are saying red hot steel being pulled from deep within the pile this is david scott from arab associates dripping from the molten steel says this firefighter referring to this steel beam saw pools of literally molten steel at the world trade center says peter tully president of the construction company we're going to see why these accounts are so very important because these temperatures cannot possibly be accounted for from the official story not jet fuel not office fires none of it uncovering red-hot metal beams ranging from molten metal which was still red hot weeks after the event molten steel at the heart of the tower's remains streams of molten metal that leaked from the hot cores and flowed down metals dripping from a beam molten steel beams the end of the beam dripping with molten steel mark loizo president of one of the cleanup contractors in this case controlled demolition inc molten steel was encountered primarily during the excavation of debris there are videotape and photos of the molten steel being dipped out by the buckets of the excavators a little river of steel flowing says who leslie robertson the world trade center structural engineer himself and his associate richard garlock the debris past the columns was red-hot molten running molten steel is pouring out of the south tower now it turns out to be molten iron as we'll see nist claims oh this is this is minutes prior to its collapse nist says this is molten metal from the airplanes well molten molten aluminum excuse me molten aluminum in daylight conditions doesn't glow bright yellow like you see pouring out of the south excuse me the out of the material held in the buckets of the crab claw excavator in fact concrete had melted and as you can see in this piece included in the today in the new york city mute police museum because the concrete melted it says it's so intense the heat that it melted like lava around everything in its path including this handgun in from building six i don't even know concrete could melt but it takes 3200 degrees fahrenheit to melt concrete office fires don't get even half of these temperatures jet fuel gets even less steel members in the debris pile that appear to have been partly evaporated in extraordinarily high temperatures says jonathan barnett the author of the fema report or one of them there's a problem here though it takes 4 000 degrees to evaporate steel more than four times the temperature of most office fires i saw melting of girders at the world trade center says this structural engineer who had unlimited access to the the landfill through the national science foundation a grant that he had and so he's documenting world trade center seven steel that's been partly evaporated he says if you remember salvador dali paintings with the clocks that are kind of melted it's like that that can only happen if you get steel yellow hot or white hot perhaps around 2 000 degrees not realizing to this day that office fires and jet fuel can't possibly explain this phenomena let's go back to massimo mizuko's new pearl harbor another proof of extremely high temperatures reached during the collapse are the twisted and mangled steel beams found at ground zero architects engineers people who work with steel welders have just never seen the level of destruction and the level of deformation of this material in our lives you saw it steal some of this thickest steel i've ever seen bent like a pretzel this eight-ton steel i-beam is six inches thick it was selected to be preserved for future generations for the near-perfect horseshoe-like bend formed during the collapse i found it hard to believe that it actually bent because of the size of it and how there's no cracks in the iron without almost a single crack in it it takes thousands of degrees to bend steel like this in fact the temperature of 2800 degrees mentioned before is not casual at all as that's exactly the temperature at which steel melts and this phenomena is documented in the fema report before the nist report the fema report building performance assessment team report came out in may of 2002 what do they document in their appendix c the metallurgical examination of the steel a one inch column reduced to half inch thickness its edges curled like a paper scroll having been thinned to almost razor sharpness rapid oxidation sulfidation intergranular melting liquid iron that's molten iron in this sulfur formed during this hot corrosion attack on the steel no clear explanation for the source of the sulfur has been identified they've got hot sulfur corrosion attack on the steel beams but they don't know where it came from they don't know where the massive heat came from perhaps the deepest mystery uncovered in the investigation says the new york times but when the nist investigation took over the fema investigation they completely omitted this evidence the metallurgical examination but since it was so very frequently asked about they had to acknowledge it in a set of faqs which they published only years later after their report sulfur they said is present in gypsum wall board prevalent in the interior petitions well that is not true calcium sulfate is present in gypsum wallboard but it is not sulfur it's chemically inert it can't turn around and attack the steel that for a hundred years it's been designed to protect we put gypsum wall board around our steel beams today it's not been a problem and besides you can include or perform experiments and see if gypsum wallboard attacks the steel when you get the hottest office fire or in this case backyard fire as you can no attack on the steel whatsoever experiment is the arbiter of competing hypotheses if the smell of the sulfur permeated the world trade center it burned that smell says john feel i can never block out that smell it haunts me sulfur burning we'll find out where it came from but let's look at john gross the co-project leader in his reaction to these questions about this molten metal first of all let's go back to your basic uh premise that there was a pool of milk molten steel i know of absolutely nobody and no eyewitness who said so nobody who's produced it but witnesses testify otherwise you'd get down below and you'd see molten steel molten steel running down the channel rails like you're in a foundry actually melted beams where it was molten steel that was being dug out underground it was still so hot that molten metal dripped on the sides of a wall the cleanup was very difficult in the beginning steel was coming out red in certain areas in the first couple weeks this fused element of of steel molten river of steel out flowing and yet here is john gross on the pile looking at the very piece of steel which he cut off and gave to fema so that they could include it in their appendix c metallurgical examination evidence of evaporated ends of the steel beam as jonathan barnett had disclosed his shadow is all over the evidence why do we have such temperatures well one supporter of the official story says 1200 degrees fahrenheit is the is the how hot the fires were nist claims 1800 degrees without any evidence to support such heat but even so there are a thousand degrees less than what is required to melt steel hydrocarbons buildings and jet fuel burning in open air can only produce temperatures of up to 1400 degrees in fact the petroleum manufacturer says in open air at 600 degrees for jet fuel which is basically just kerosene [Music] so burning in open air so but steel and iron had definitely melted during the event as you see here we can tell by the color of molten metals what their temperature is in this case 2500 degrees bright golden yellow fahrenheit so what caused the steel to melt and to get so hot well nist had this question very frequently and finally published it years later any molten steel in the wreckage was more likely due to the high temperature resulting from long exposure within the pile rather than to short exposure to fires or explosions while the buildings were standing so wait a minute they're saying that the heat built up so bad underneath all that pulverized concrete wait this there's a law it's called the conservation of energy in a closed system such as fires burning under pulverized concrete powder in the basements of the world trade center the amount of energy is fixed you can't create any more energy inside the system the fire can't somehow get hotter than the capacity of the fuel it's burning especially when it's smothered by concrete powder and water they said they put like a lake of water in there you can only convert the energy you have from one form to another in other words the heat is dissipated it's not increased so what could have produced all that heat let's take a look at thermite as a possibility um what is thermite anyway an incendiary used by the military thermite is a compound of iron oxide and aluminum which when ignited sustains an extreme heat reaction creating molten iron in just two seconds thermite can reach temperatures over 4500 degrees fahrenheit quite enough to liquefy steel we know that open-air fires cannot burn hot enough to melt steel but metal had melted at the base of the towers appendix c of the fema report describes sulfur residues on the world trade center steel the new york times called this the deepest mystery of all sulfur slightly lowers the melting point of iron and iron oxide and iron sulfide had formed on the surface of the structural steel sulfur used with thermite is called thermate producing even faster results well maybe we're getting somewhere here because if thermite were used it would explain the presence of elemental iron which we're about to look at an awful lot of evidence for in a moment it would explain the presence of extreme heat thermite produces 4000 degree elemental iron and it would explain the presence of sulfur because sulfur is added to thermite to become thermate becomes much more effective at burning through steel [Music] so were the guidelines from nfpa 921 followed this is the authoritative source for explosion in fire investigation that's used not only in this country but largely around the world they say look for unusual residues that could arise from thermite or other pyrotechnic materials this claims they found no corroborating evidence to suggest that explosives were used but a year later when pressed they finally admit we did not test for the presence of explosive residue you can't find what you refuse to test for but others did it wasn't that difficult to find stephen jones physicist nuclear physicist formerly from brigham young university suggests that gosh well if there might were use it produce a characteristic burn pattern a white yellow hot liquid metal which turns out to be molten iron which we see pouring out of the south tower minutes prior to its collapse he says it produced a whitish cloud of aluminum oxide ash which we see rising from the material pouring out of the south tower and trailing these freely flying structural steel sections which we looked at in some detail last week back to forward two why are steel beams ejected in every direction by the hundreds and even by the thousands trailing thick white smoke clouds steel beams are not flammable in office fire conditions what how did the ends of these steel beams get on fire and again it you see thousands of them looks more like the volcanic eruption in the tongan sea in 2009 upward outward arching streamers freely flying solid objects trailed by thick white smoke clouds a geometry of fireworks indicating massive explosions and both towers are the same thick white smoke clouds trailing these beams were pulling stuff out big sections of iron that were literally on fire on the other end they would hit the air and burst into flames but steel beams are not flammable in office fire conditions let's look at thermite in some detail he says it would look steven jones it would leave behind a unique chemical evidence common elements such as iron aluminum copper calcium silicon but more unusual elements like fluorine and manganese left behind in the residue do we find such things these elements on the periodic table of the elements well somebody sent him a small piece of this chunk of molten metal which was from one of the larger meteorites they called them this fused molten metal anyway he got a chip of this performs electron microprobe data he says gosh this is predominantly iron so he rules out aluminum from the jet planes it has abundant manganese so he rules out molten structural steel as a major component so it's not just melted steel it has aluminum sulfur and potassium hence the molten material is the residue of thermite there's no question but he goes further it has manganese and fluorine in abundance manganese and fluorine where does that come from manganese is from the potassium permanganate which is commonly used as an oxidizer in thermite fluorine is used in special thermite charges called saw gels hence these are often present in the residue and are part of a thermite fingerprint but interestingly enough saw gels would leave behind quite an interesting residue 1-3 diphenyl propane well the epa analysis of the dust finds one molecules molecule at levels that dwarfed all others what was that 1-3-diphenyl propane we've never observed it in any other sampling we've ever done says eric schwartz of the epa so we have another sculptor who hears about the work of stephen jones sends him the ends of a piece of slag here from the end of that sculpture that beam from the world trade center so in this case stephen jones performs x-ray fluorescence analysis what does he find iron sulfur potassium manganese the ingredients of thermite yet again particularly iron and sulfur and aluminum and of course the manganese it a dead giveaway of what was going on here in the beams at the world trade center you can make your own thermite cutter charges in your backyard actually you can buy it on ebay put it in a shaped cutter charge as as john cole did here in florida uh he was reduced in thickness with gaping holes thin to almost razor sharpness with a swiss cheese appearance he found the same thing that fema found and documented in their appendix c in 2002. i mean it gets to be so clear what's going on here in fact there's inventions of devices for shaped cutter charges using thermite which issue molten iron in hundreds of milliseconds much more effective at cutting through greater thicknesses of steel than c4 and rdx even high energy explosives that are used in normal controlled demolitions why would they not have wanted to use high energy explosives well they provide a very loud bang and a very bright flash audio and visual signatures they that they might have wanted to avoid in a deceptive controlled demolition there are devices whose casings themselves is made out of consumable consolidated thermite nothing left behind but molten iron which was found in abundance the world trade center and is found not only uh by stephen jones and others but by the u.s geological survey doing their studies on the dust which they produced the particle atlas of the world trade center dust in 2005. what do they find billions of previously molten iron microspheres so they had extreme heat they're iron not steel again the byproduct of thermite and they're spherical they are they amount to up to four tons by extrapolation of how much is in all the world trade center dust this residue of thermite it's 150 times the background amount of dust which is not even spherical but this is what you find in house dust office dust if you will but these are spherical there's 150 times and they're formed during the event according to rj lee not before by the iron workers the welders putting the world trade center together not afterward by the ironworkers taking apart the pieces in the aftermath but during the event the melting of iron r.j lee is a environmental concern also doing studies on the dust the epa says these molten iron microspheres are so prevalent that even though they don't know where they came from they use them as a signature component in order to distinguish the world trade center dust from other dust but they have no idea where they came from well here's a possibility this is a thermite experiment in a controlled condition which produces bright flash very high temperatures up to 4000 degrees and lots of sparks well they look like sparks but they're molten iron you see when you under pressurized conditions liquid materials form themselves into spheres by the surface tension [Music] is that what could also explain the toasting of the tops of these cars around the world trade center the falling liquid molten iron droplets what other rational hypothesis could explain the toasting of these cars well outside the world trade center complex and what else was found in the world trade center dust any hint of unignited thermite well a small team of scientists led by niels harrit in copenhagen is sent independently collected seven samples and they documented four of them in this particular paper they're a sixteenth of an inch large these curious red gray chips that occur in all of the samples of dust they're red on one side gray on the other indicating that they are applied in a fluid they're attracted by a magnet so they get real curious because paint doesn't do this they find by examining the red layer iron oxide aluminum powder so iron and aluminum the key ingredients of thermite are in this paint shouldn't be there they get real curious zoom in 50 000 times into the red layer with a nuclear microscope and find particles that are a thousand times smaller than the diameter of a human hair particles of iron oxide rhomboidal shaped crystals aluminum platelets again the ingredients of thermite set in an organic bed of oxygen silica carbon organic material which in explosives like tnt expand rapidly because they make gases which causes the destructive effect associated with explosives interesting well the published data on this shows from lawrence livermore lab that at about 425 degrees fahrenheit excuse me celsius about 758 fahrenheit they ignite it's basically a heater a differential scanning calorimeter and they can measure the energy after ignition and it's off the charts indicating that it is indeed a thermitic material their exothermic reactions well the same thing happens to these red gray chips collected from the world trade center dust samples and what happens when they ignite they produce molten iron microspheres with the same chemical signature as the molten iron microspheres in the world trade center does have so you see we know where these molten iron microspheres came from they came from these red gray chips as if we didn't know they're found attached to partially ignited red gray chips as you can see here and here so you see we have a self-corroborating set of repeatable experimental data that could be used in a court of law to bring to justice the real perpetrators of 9 11. since we know how the towers came down this is a very sophisticated material when you reduce the size of these physical particles down to the nano scale the surface volume increases exponentially so the speed of the chemical reaction is virtually instantaneous engineering an incendiary which traditionally works by means of heat massive heat into an explosive it's not made in a cave in afghanistan it's made only in the most advanced defense contracting laboratories you see they've proven in this 25-page peer-reviewed paper in the bentham open chemical physics journal that this is active unreacted thermitic material incorporating nanotechnology it's highly energetic pyrotechnic or explosive this conclusion has not been challenged by anyone submitting their own peer-reviewed paper that's what you do to challenge somebody you think has a a wrong conclusion you submit your own paper this has not been done so what we've looked at last week was direct evidence of destruction with explosives fire doesn't create these features any of them uh and what well what we looked at this week i mean in these final three and so if fires cause less robust structures to collapse they do so asymmetrically with gradual deformation following the path of least resistance especially these fires causing all of the destruction that we've looked at over the last couple of weeks in fact the thermal imaging videos released from the freedom of information act request reveal fires that are only 200 degrees fahrenheit at the most nist has some evidence that they reached maybe 500 or 600 degrees but we're still a fifth of the temperatures required to to melt steel uh less than so this is damning evidence to the official story and so what do the experts say again at least those experts without financial or political obligations that might sway their objective opinion in the matter let's listen to ron brookman one of a hundred structural engineers signed on to the petition demanding a new investigation into the destruction of these towers he says it doesn't look anything like a heat induced gravitational collapse mechanism why did the complete collapse of the towers become inevitable as claimed by nist and we got to that last week they had no scientific analysis or calculation to substantiate how these buildings collapsed even though they were tasked by congress to determine the cause of the collapse in footnote 13 on page 82 we found that they had their own agenda they went to the initiation of collapse and that's as far as they were willing to go ron brookman says why would all 110 stories drop straight down to the ground in 10 seconds pulverizing the contents to dust and twisted steel ed moonyak fire protection engineer says the fires were very weak nist reports confirmed that the steel temperatures were low the world trade center collapses have no resemblance to any previous high-rise fire collapse probably because there was no previous [Music] collapse by fire the destruction of evidence is something we need to look at too because i mean this was a crime scene and surely the powers that be preserved the steel for review by forensic engineers before it was taken away well let's listen to one of those forensic engineers after 9 11 we realized that authority of new york and new jersey has sent all this speed that we need to study that's why i'm here to study steve haseno steve's recycling plan to go to china for recycling for what for 15 cents a pound just nothing and all the evidence of steel went to melting pot the evidence of the steel went to the melting pot to china for recycling before engineers could get their hands on it and do a proper forensic analysis in fact mike bloomberg mayor of new york who's an engineer himself says just looking at a piece of metal generally doesn't tell you anything justifying getting rid of the steel and using computer analysis in which they could bluff their way through this cover-up of the crime of the century prompting bill manning editor-in-chief of fire engineering magazine to cry out crucial evidence that could answer many questions is on the slobo to china showing an astounding ignorance of government officials to the value of a thorough scientific investigation the destruction and removal of evidence must stop immediately but it didn't in fact in easily the largest and most perplexing structural failures in history starting just two weeks after 9 11 we have the removal of this steel from the site to barges at 400 truckloads a day sent to china for recycling this is the illegal destruction of evidence in a crime scene which is why so many architects and engineers have found through the use of the scientific method that the hypothesis of explosions and controlled demolitions and the use of incendiaries is what is really going on here having today we've looked at features 8 9 and 10 high temperatures in the world trade center towers last week we looked at features one through seven this is direct evidence of destruction with explosives fire doesn't create these features any of them let alone all of them additional circumstantial corroborative eyewitness testimony and evidence we note that this is proof of controlled demolition prompting 3 400 architects and engineers to demand a new investigation and we hope you'll join them because when you do you will have made your public stance on the petition and again 20 000 uh supporters who are not even architection engineers have already uh put signed the petition in addition to those professionals so i imagine you might have some questions now do we have questions andy yeah we got a few of them in so now is the time to get them in if you haven't asked them yet please submit any questions you have in the same input form that we talked about earlier that's an [Music] ae911truth.org go to continuing education and find the live webinars you'll see a box right there to type it in in the meantime we're going to tell you about some of the ways that you can get involved if now that you're informed you agree this evidence is compelling and warrants a new investigation well while you're there uh folks go ahead and subscribe to our email newsletter so that you can just put your name and your email in there and we'll send you our latest efforts getting a real investigation and the latest evidence that we've put together all the all the outreach efforts we're making so be sure to to subscribe to our email newsletter and get informed but with the evidence there's an incredible evidence section right there on our website papers videos you name it it's all there and sign the petition again demanding a new investigation join those architects and engineers and be sure to donate because again we do not have federal grants and corporate grants to keep us going we have a lot of work to do to wake up the the public the media the universities the professionals architects and engineers out there and our elected representatives so that's what we are all about and so it takes funds uh we we have a lot of work to do you can support us uh on your own just do that and become a member for as little as a cup of coffee a month you can be uh join the family of sustaining supporters of ae 911 truth hey if that's not possible maybe you can volunteer and help us out is that a possibility andy it always is and a lot of times people think they can't really make a difference in this world they think that everything is decided by people they watch on television i'm telling you that is not true most of the what it gets accomplished by ordinary people has nothing to do with talent or know how you pick those things up as you go along it's just deciding that you're going to do it and a good way to do that and pick up some talents along the way too is uh fill out the volunteer format ae 911 truth we've got a good team people who help out when they can in their spare time and we don't ask too much of you but if you got a few hours a week to contribute help us out help us with this mission we strongly recommend doing that it's a very easy application process just go to the page fill it out we'll give you a call within a few days and see where you'll best fit in a lot of that really depends on you and where you want to fit in so please consider doing then be part of something important yeah absolutely it's important um and uh you can do things on your own too reach out to your local elected representatives the media television radio newspaper tell them hey there's 3 400 architects and engineers challenging the official story send them our our brochures our dvds you can screen the dvds you can show the brochures one at a time uh just hand them to one to every architect and engineer in your city make them aware make them aware of the 300 000 four-year finite element analysis computer modeling of world trade center seven by the university of alaska who spent uh a lot of effort in in the end completely pulled the rug out from underneath the official report finding that fire did not cause the collapse of world trade center seven and it didn't experience a progressive collapse but a global collapse caused by the near simultaneous failure of all of its columns now what how does that happen well we've shown you the evidence of how that happens in these last two or three well in the case of building seven the first in this three-part series so we've sent 75 000 postcards out educating engineers around the country as to what really happened here because the implications are staggering we've also sent them uh many of them the universities and our elected representatives and many of you have sent them as well in our most recent program uh the dvd called seven which is the story about the university of alaska and professor leroy halsey and their his effort to bring sanity to a world that has closed its eyes to the most important event of the century so um we're asking you to to join us uh and and look at our conferences that we've been giving and uh support the effort to bring justice to jeff campbell who uh was murdered in the 106th floor of the north tower and that's what one of the things that inspired this group of five fire commissioners to demand a new investigation they were inspired by the request for correction which we have submitted uh highlighting the fraud in the nist report and we're asking you to get inspired and call your representative we'll actually do the meeting isn't that right andy that is exactly right we're happy to do these meetings they're over the phone so we don't even have to travel and because of the whole world situation it's made this opportunity present itself to us and to the 9 11 truth community but you got to take that first step because if we're not in the congressman's district then they're not going to be as interested in what we have to say it seems like they should be considering the evidence that's presented in this important event but they still want to hear from constituents first so you get involved by going to your congressman's website you look up their form where you try to schedule a meeting and you ask for a phone meeting with yourself and members of ae 911 truth with their staffers to discuss this evidence and what you're seeing on the screen here in front of you the bobby mcelveen world trade center investigation act this is the path to justice for the nearly three thousand people that died on september 11th is named after bobby mcelveen who was killed as he was entering the north tower lobby on that day and what this would do is it would establish a select committee and it can be passed in either house of congress that would look into the evidence that richard is presenting it's actually written in such a way that they can't just drag nest out to rehash the same talking points and call it a day they really have to look into the possibility that nanothermite was used to bring these towers down but again as i say every week members of congress are creatures that respond they don't unless they got some agenda of their own that they came to office with they don't do something they'd rather not do unless they get a lot of pressure from their constituents so that's why you got to get involved in big ways and in small ways and if you can only afford to do the small ways you can give them a call and leave them a message send them a letter but get involved and let them know this issue still exists and we're not giving up thank you andy and you guys should know that we have gotten a promise from the u.s attorney in manhattan to comply with the law requiring him to give 57 now 60 exhibits of this evidence to a special grand jury and we're suing them to ensure that that happens we're also suing the fbi to turn over our evidence that we gave to them with an assessment to turn it over to congress as they were required to do by the 2015 911 commission review and that is in legal works as well and uh we've made a documentary that you should all see it's it's uh got 40 high-rise architects structural engineers metallurgists chemists physicists controlled demolition experts all laying out this evidence that we touched on today and it is dramatic so i want to show you just a couple of minutes of this film i don't want to be involved in conspiracy theories you know there are lots of them they can go on we can speculate on that forever what we really need to know is how how those buildings came down world trade center 7 collapsed because of fires fueled by office furnishings it did not collapse from explosives or from fuel oil fires to undermine scientific integrity is to undermine our democracy this is what nist has done denied and ignored crucial evidence the american people absolutely need the truth of 9 11. [Music] more than 1500 architects and engineers and 12 000 others including many scientists have signed the petition calling for a scientific investigation of the destruction of the twin towers and world trade center building center the report issued by the national institute of standards and technology referred to as nist was not valid science they're talking about a single column their collapse or failure that resulted in a total collapse of the building building number seven uh descended in free fall for the first 100 feet which means that there was absolutely no resistance to the scent whatsoever so all of the columns really needed to be severed at the same time the symmetry is the smoking gun nist has admitted it went into free fall for eight stories you don't need to be an engineer or an architect to see what happened to those buildings this is controlled demolition take away what i saw it was a classic implosion the center of the core the penthouse area starts to move first and then the building follows along with it nist excluded the documents from fema and appendix c that documented the evidence of melting steel in an office fire you cannot generate enough heat to melt steel there were these iron microspheres present in all of the dust samples they needed to have been formed in extremely high temperatures all the characteristics of the microspheres along with what i see in the attack of the the beams that were actually found tell me that thermite was involved in the dust what we have found was a modern version of thermite which we called nanothermite nist concedes that they found no evidence for explosives so then we asked them well did you look and they said no we did not look for explosives or residues of explosives and in fact the evidence is overwhelming that these red-gray crystals are very high-temperature incendiaries and we have watched as scientific integrity has been undermined in scientific research politicized in an effort to advance predetermined ideological object if this is a crime i think everybody agrees it's a crime evidence was removed from the scene of the crime you can't do science when you are deprived of the evidence and when your hypothesis is the least valid instead of the most likely and the most likely hypothesis in the case of building 7 wasn't even mentioned this is not science [Music] yes you can look at this uh free on youtube the one hour version and the documentary is available in its entirety hour and a half as well as uh additional bonus dvd with extended interviews excerpts from all those uh experts um that's uh in our store at ae911truth.org i encourage you to get that one and and the 50-page booklet beyond misinformation you can download it uh on our uh on our website and and at beyondmisinformation.org and it's extraordinary it completely pulls the rug out from underneath most every aspect of of the the essential elements of nist and uh our classic lecture on this subject uh 911 blueprint for truth uh now 15 14 years old free on youtube as is the 15 minute documentary narrated by actor ed asner just on building seven very very well done hey let's get back to those questions andy there we go the mute button is finally off uh okay our first question says building seven officially caught on fire because of the north tower collapse but barry jennings was complaining about the heat before either of the twin towers collapsed any comments i was unaware that barry jennings was complaining about heat before the collapse of the towers do you know anything about that andy i don't know anything about it uh i guess we'd have to look at his testimony again and see if this is something that we missed yeah and and send us a link from the questioner right info e nanoliventruth.org that's the uh that's the best place to send us stuff and a lot of people will see it yeah that's info at ae911.org so we'll reserve judgment on that one uh for another day and let the commenter know or the question or no uh in the link below and they provided a good link here the canadian construction industry magazine states that world trade center seven did not collapse due to fire canada and the world owes your team an expression of gratitude and a minimum until fire uh not the cause was acknowledged it is to be expected that there should have been a flurry of activity by responsible committees responsible for building codes and fire protection codes convening in emergency sessions and i would think a flurry of engineering scholars writing graduate theses or publications about all three collapses in a variety of study areas has anyone on your team done a research of academic papers and compiled a list of them i think a library worth of scientific papers should exist thanks for all that you are doing are doing for harmony truth and life and then he provides the link to the magazine article which i did take a look at yeah well that's fascinating uh we certainly do have uh a whole bunch of these academic papers which have been produced supporting getting to the truth of 9 11. um they're on our website under the evidence section and there's a list of peer-reviewed papers it's called collected articles on 9 11. it is a four inch thick binder which i along with some other members of ae911 truth went to the office of i didn't forget his name our our key critic our liberal intellectual uh at mit chomsky yes thank you noam chomsky um we handed it to him because he had previously said you need to do peer-reviewed articles so anyway we gave him 72 of them in his office and we got a picture of us handing him that binder he looked a little sheepish i doubt he'd read him but at least i haven't heard him say again you need to do peer-reviewed articles you know this has been done we're not getting the attention because of gatekeepers like him but um this andy do you remember the specifics from the canadian construction industry magazine i don't i don't remember this article honestly so you know the thing is we don't google ourselves every day and so someone's writing about us you know that could slip by our radar for uh you know several months so if you actually see something like that send it to us but i also want to encourage people and this is how i got my start is to write your own articles and if you need facts checked you can contact us we got people that can help you with that if you've got a question about the evidence or something but you know we really need people to kind of grab the bull by the horns and start writing their own take on the evidence especially if they agree with us um and get it into publications around them send them to newspapers start blogs whatever happened to blogs they used to be a big thing and now i don't ever hear about any blogs anymore so start blogs and start blogging about this issue and get it out as many people as you can and just do it from your own take and from your own perspective and your own writing style and that is very helpful as long as you're accurate and come across as professional trust me the more people that are talking about this the better yes this um article is in the daily commercial news by construct connect it is a widely read construction related website news center for the construction industry um what it is is an article about our work specifically uh the work of the university of alaska citing the halsey study which again says even in the article here that the uh that it says right here uh that's funny i just saw it uh column 79 80 and 81 did not fail at the lower floors of the building and were not subjected to heat above floor 30 because there was no fires there even if they did they would not trigger a horizontal progression of core column failures and the team was unable to find any other plausible cause for the progressive sequence of failures so um also they they cite the report in a typical building collapse uh world trade center seven would be expected to experience a combination of axial rotation and bending members resulting in a disjointed asymmetrical collapse at less than free fall acceleration so that's speculating at what it might look like were it to actually fall naturally but they say that uh the collapse was straight down in a pancake fashion with about two and a quarter seconds of free fall acceleration that's as fast as a bowling ball falling out of the sky and which is faster and faster each second because of the nature of acceleration um so yeah you would expect that article to generate a whole lot more controversy than we were aware that it did generate there's just a lot of people that don't want to acknowledge reality especially when that reality a was so painful 19 years ago we were all in a state of shock and awe psychological operation against the american people people all around the world actually and b um i forgot what b was so uh it it it's it's rather it's rather extraordinary that the people don't want to don't want to look at what happened i mean we don't want to bring up that pain from the original but also we don't want to buck the system we don't want to go against what our this is b by the way we don't want to go against trade what's been established right if if science has been settled and the official story and the government and the media have all been saying for so many years now that this was due to fire and jet planes impacts and who am i to challenge all of that you know it's overwhelming well i'm a pissed off architect personally so i was lied to on a massive scale and so were you so if if you want to if you want to find out what you're made of take on going against the system whatever it is for you maybe it's covid maybe it's something else maybe it's vaccines experimental gene therapy whatever it is we'd like you to join us at 911 truth because we think this is the domino that will set in motion all of these controversial um false flag operations that we have been given over the last over our lifetime certainly and beyond so join us that's that's what i'm asking for that's right i agree 100 and i'll just add to just because uh the people on tv and who write the newspapers claim that they're the experts they're the ones who have to create reality when you actually get to talk to some of them you realize that they're not necessarily that's not necessarily there because they're the best at their job it's usually because they're willing to toe the line so you got to have confidence in yourself and who are you you're just like everyone else every job that's out there they made them that they made it so that humans can do them and you're a human being and uh you're just as powerful and smart as anybody else yeah all right our next question says nist said since aluminum melts at lower temperatures therefore the orange metal pouring out of the south tower has to be aluminum since when do investigations rule out possibilities based on assumptions well that's all they got [Music] they don't have the science behind them so they have to rule out possibilities based on assumptions i like the way you said that the orange metal and yellow metal and white hot metal pouring out of the south tower for instance is direct evidence of molten iron aluminum doesn't melt at those temperatures excuse me it melts at lower temperatures it doesn't glow bright yellow and white hot in daylight conditions is what i meant um and and it's been proven and this says oh this this is aluminum mixed with organic materials well dr stephen jones the physicist has done experiments where he's mixed molten aluminum with organic materials and it doesn't glow bright hot doesn't grow glow bright yellow in fact it does the opposite it just gets coated with silvery aluminum these this is clearly molten iron at temperatures exceeding its melting point 2800 degrees and the color gives us the temperature it's it's uh the physics of all of this is overwhelmingly in our favor what is not in our favor is going up against the world view of people who do not want to be psychologically challenged and who don't want to turn around and challenge the authority we get that we're trying to find those of you who are capable of reaching past your comfort zone and realizing that you were shafted hoaxed uh taken advantage of on a massive scale and we hope you'll get pissed off like we do we have and uh and we're driven so we're looking for more volunteers we're looking for donors whatever your conscience guides you to do there's something for you to do and we went over those earlier so thanks for joining us in that effort okay we have one more question here from facebook and it says i am no engineer but could pure pressured oxygenated fires reach those temperatures [Music] well they have oxyacetylene torches which reach greater temperatures than that but this is a finely crafted instrument based on scientific principles which the adjustments of the oxygen and acetylene which is a gas levels maximize the temperature we don't have that in normal office fires which is why normal office fires don't get to be about 500 maybe a thousand degrees fahrenheit so uh no it's it's uh it's completely out of the question which is why nist doesn't try to explain how those fires got so hot they they ignore the 2 800 degree temperatures altogether and even as you heard john gross do deny it even though he's standing on the pile exposing a partially evaporated beam which takes 4 000 degrees temperatures the only thing they they had was a rather lame speculation that maybe the fires got so hot because they were covered up with concrete powder and water down in the basement i mean that's your best come on maybe maybe it was the gypsum board that yielded all this sulfur that attacked the steel hey you saw the experiment gypsum board does not turn around and attack the steel that it's been designed to protect for over a hundred years so something else is going on here and it's bigger than ae911 truth we can't do it alone we we need you we need you to take this information even the link from today's webinar send it to every architect and engineer you know every media representative every elected representative every friend that you have every professional technical professional and academician in physics and engineering do something if you don't you will not be able to look at your grandchildren in the eye and said i did my best to expose this so please do something and that brings us to the end of part three the twin towers in extreme heat last week we looked at the twin towers of explosive destruction guess what we do it all over again in may which is coming right up the first week of may thursday 1 p.m pacific we go into part 1 again and do the whole series every week in may so join us for that it's the 47-story skyscraper that collapsed at free-fall acceleration in seven seconds top to bottom symmetrical collapse which the official story says happened by normal office fires no plane hit this building either they don't even have that to work with so join us as we expose lie after lie in nist and thanks again everybody thanks andy for helping us we'll see you in april bye for now ,3
84,EUJozeN7WyM,while the election officials the media and the internet monopoly insist there's no voter fraud at the same time they're frantically working to keep us from seeing it when judge jeanine planned to expose the massive election corruption on her show fox news suspended her then fox actually censored the white house press conference which provided extensive evidence of election fraud we want every legal vote to be counted and we want every illegal vote well i just think we have to be very clear she's charging up the other side is welcoming fraud and welcoming illegal voting unless she has more details to back that up i can't in good countenance continue showing you this breaking news people are leaving fox news in droves they are in shock that someone had the audacity to question them to disobey their decree remember just because cnn says or even fox news says that somebody's present doesn't make them president so i think everybody wants to know that this was done properly and legally what is happening like tracy and i think we have to look into every one of these concerns i know this may come as a surprise but the media doesn't have the authority to call an election and when there's a dispute we will follow the legal process all the way to the u.s supreme court and once we submit the overwhelming evidence of systematic voter fraud all we have to do is count to five everybody watch joe biden promise not to declare victory until the votes are certified president biden final question for you will you urge your supporters to stay calm while the vote is counted and will you pledge not to declare victory until the election is independently certified yes while those who have witnessed the attempts to steal this election continue to report it the heart of the widespread systematic voting fraud is with the electronic voting machines owned by this globalist as i wrote about in a heartbeat away the man who controls the voting machines is linked to leftist billionaire george soros he's chairman of his board a key executive of the company is nancy pelosi's former chief of staff a major shareholder dianne feinstein's husband making dominion voting machines heavily promoted by the clinton foundation well at least they're all working together oh it's also the same company credited with the last minute glitch where all the votes suddenly went to venezuelan dictator hugo chavez well they really are all working together here's a fun fact guess what happens when you type in antifa.com yep it takes you right to the biden campaign wow they really are all working together these democrat dominion machines just happen to be the ones used in 28 key states including arizona michigan nevada wisconsin and pennsylvania and these machines come with some customized features excuse me glitches they can both add huge blocks of votes to the democrat while the republican gets none and flip votes from the republican to the democrat here's proof beginning with kentucky where 560 votes were flipped from republican matt bevin to the democrat and so here we are before the update and now i'm going to start walking you forward watch the gold here comes the update from clarity boom there it is let's look at matt bevin he now has 661 675 but look down below he did have 662 235 at the exact same second then andy beshear has gone up 560 votes matt bevin has gone down 560 votes you just saw the democrat dominion machines flip votes from one candidate to another but take a look at what they did in michigan in this round of updates 138 339 biden votes were added without a single person in the state of michigan voting for trump statistically impossible it's like flipping a coin 138 339 times in a row and getting heads every single time and the democrats say we're the crazy ones for questioning it well let's find out remember i've got to get heads 138 339 times in a row heads off to a good start heads maybe the democrats are on to something let's check it out tails i'll keep trying all this wasn't enough in antrim county ballots were counted for democrats that were meant for republicans causing a 6 000 vote swing against our candidates the county clerk came forward and said tabulating software glitched and caused a miscalculation of the votes since then we have now discovered that 47 counties use this same software in the same capacity interim county had to hand count all of the ballots and these counties that use this software need to closely examine their results for similar discrepancies well now another vote swap glitch has been discovered in wisconsin bringing back 19 500 votes to president trump removing biden's lead here's another vote swap glitch caught on camera in pennsylvania nineteen thousand nine hundred and fifty eight votes switched from president trump to joe biden in one minute watch in real time president trump's totals go down here's the first time we see pennsylvania on the screen with trump at one million six hundred and ninety thousand to get him perspective donald trump's leading here he's leading here he's leading in a second we'll see pennsylvania back up on the screen at one million six hundred and seventy thousand these normally would be trump as election results are tallied the totals naturally go up unless you're using a democratic dominion voting machine in a traditional map that's where we're going to be that's where we'll be as we go to the west coast somewhere in south america in that ballpark it's not and there it is nearly 20 000 votes stolen from president trump right in front of our eyes here it is side by side with evidence of the nearly 20 000 trump boats removed then there was another voting machine glitch in georgia i could go on but you get the idea former nsa intelligence officer bill benny had this to say about the so-called voting machine glitch things that they're calling glitches and software that are uh randomly changing only certain votes they're not glitches at all those are programmed and those are programmed into the software it's doing exactly what it's supposed to do if there's a problem in software we call those bugs if the bug is a is in the software it does everything consistently with everything not just selectively picking things if only certain things are selected picked and changed that's not a bug that's designed in the software that's intentional no the democrat dominion machines don't have a glitch it's a tried and true standard feature about to be exposed and eliminated just another way that president trump is keeping his promise to drain the swamp and when he's through well i'll let the president tell you and when i'm reelected the best is yet to come this is the moment where we rise up and take our country back and trump's second term it's going to be epic ,2
85,5N0SfkKQNhg,"hi this is Richard gage with architects and engineers for 911 truth we're here at one post straight in San Francisco speaking with state director for Dianne Feinstein senator and he brought with him a 45-year explosives expert done danhanson von dot Henson who proceeded to shut our presentation down almost immediately without being open to it at all staining well I've seen all your stuff I've read all your stuff and through the questions and answers that became exceedingly obvious that he hadn't seen or read much of any of he wasn't interested in learning anything he was simply declaring that they would be impossible as Jim Huffman cited how I am not convinced and I will not be convinced and this is what we come up against it is the emotional programming that governs rationality in a lot of people in all of us presumably but him more than others in the case of 911 evidence which we brought and presented before we were shut down but we proceeded to present more evidence nano-thermite spheres lateral injection freefall acceleration building seven evidence coming straight down against 40,000 tons of structural steel all of that evidence was meaningless to him because he could not conceive of how it could be possible that such a conspiracy could happen because after all we would have heard about it by now somebody would have talked our government wouldn't do this to us all of these excuses for not thinking for not looking at the evidence for not being awake enough and willing enough to have an open mind even though they said oh I have an open mind that doesn't make an open mic it's fascinating the psychology we're up against and presenting the evidence for explosive demolition to people who can't conceive of it it's like pouring water into a cup that's already full it can't go in so I was ready to leave after 10-15 minutes but i SAT through a whole lot of other denials of evidence as we presented other points in addition to the building's the hijackers the airline put options the the other evidence that we went through we ran out of batteries this one's still going good so um we're we're done with this office I think yeah they're probably done with us too they're done with us so we'll we'll go to where we can be heard and we won't stop Thanks okay fabulous ",3
86,mAbgrGdx5Xg,yeah I think Google has really taken advantage of a lot of people and I think that's a very serious thing and it's a very serious charge Trump's beef that Google is mostly showing unfavorable news about him he tweeted this very early this morning Google search results for Trump news shows only the viewing reporting of fake news media in other words they have it rigged for me and others so that almost all stories and news is bad they're really treading on very very troubled territory and they have to be careful it's not fair to large portions of the population well it's true a lot of stories about Trump are negative it's also kind of hard to put a positive spin on the conviction of Paul Manafort the guilty plea of Michael Cohen or Trump calling Omarosa Newman a dog google shot back today saying in a statement when users type queries into the Google search bar our goal is to make sure they receive the most relevant answers in a matter of seconds search is not used to set a political agenda and we don't bias our results toward any political ideology it should be noted that the top Google search results for Trump today had Fox News near the top which seemed to undermine his claims of suppression ,2
87,V6yHPRsxyRo,"all right so let's get started there's gonna be a big day for you guys today and what I'm gonna be preaching about I'm not gonna tell you the title the sermon yet what I want to do is I want to ask you a few questions it's not gonna be unorthodox it's just gonna be questions raise your hand if you if you haven't if you agree with what I'm about to say do you agree that the government or science lied to us about evolution raise your hand okay that's the whole room do you believe and agree that the government or science lied to us about the Big Bang whole room do you believe and do you agree that the government lied about our earth oh so you guys all agree well what I'm preaching about today is called the Flat Earth and I'm sure you guys have heard of this theory before but I'm sure you've never heard it from somebody who actually studied the Bible and all the sermons and preaching and verses you can find on it are going to be from the ESV and the NIV and people who are not spirit-filled people have not read their Bible cover-to-cover but what I'm gonna preach to you is that the earth is actually flat and you've been lied to your whole life and this is going to blow your mind when you see the scripture on it and when you see the science on it and it only took me about eight minutes to convince brother Justin and brother Eric that the earth was flat and I'm gonna show you without a doubt that the Bible teaches this is flat grab your packet from under your desk so under your under your desk I gave you guys a packet it's gonna help you visualize everything I'm about to tell you and don't worry this sermon is gonna be completely based in Scripture this sermon will be completely based in Scripture and what I need you to do I only had so many packets so if you don't have a packet please share with somebody behind you I can only print so much from work so what you're looking at is not a perfect example but this is essentially what the Flat Earth looks like so I'm showing this to the camera but you take a look at it and this may sound funny to you right it may sound like weird and you probably have heard it from people who you know sound like heretics sometimes I'm telling you that keep all those thoughts aside I need you to have an open mind today if you trust me as a pastor if you trust me as a preacher and if you've heard my other sermons you know that I base everything on the Bible but good thing I have a little science also to back up everything I'm about to tell you so what you're looking at in your packet is an essentially an example of what the earth actually looks like so the earth is a circle but I'm going to explain everything to you from the Bible first so what you're seeing on top you see that circular dome looking thing that is what it's called the firmament that is what the Bible calls the firmament so you're in Genesis chapter 1 but I just want to ask you remember I just asked you a few questions you rose your hand if you if you had the answer so let me ask you a few questions those of you I'm not going to put anything against you I'm not going to make you feel bad raise your hand if you believe that the earth is a sphere it's okay okay so half the room right let me ask you something do you know anything why you believe that let me ask you four questions that you should know if you honestly believe this one what is the angle of our axis of rotation on the earth raise your hand if you know the answer to that the angle of the axis of our rotation of the earth because the earth is spinning so but it's spinning on an angle or in direct not you you know the answer you know about twenty 23.5 correct okay how fast does the earth spin around the Sun according to science raise your hand if you know the answer correct about a thousand miles an hour and then what is the formula for the curvature of the earth if you believe that the earth is a sphere nobody okay so what the formula is is it's eight inches per mile squared so one person maybe two had the answer to all those two two of those questions but you guys believe in something right you guys believe in this thing right but do you honestly honestly from your heart know anything about it or do you believe it because you've been taught it since you were a child in the same way we're taught evolution from childhood and you just told me everybody in this room that does not you everybody in this room raise their hand they still only they they do not believe in the Big Bang you know you have to believe in the Big Bang to believe that the earth is a sphere you don't get to pick the reason I say that is because the earth is spinning around the Sun according to the science because of the Sun's gravity the Sun is traveling through our galaxy of five hundred fifteen thousand miles per hour why is it doing that because of the Big Bang and our galaxy is continuing to travel even faster that into nothing obviously the galaxy is traveling through the universe but the universe is expanding into nothing that's what science tells you so you have to believe in the Big Bang to believe that the earth is a sphere you don't get to pick and people that try and make this distinction no the earth is a sphere and it's circling around the Sun and our galaxy is moving at five hundred fifteen thousand miles per hour and there's billions of other planets and there's billions of other stars but the Big Bang isn't true and evolution isn't true you don't get to say that it's the unholy trinity you have to believe in three or you don't get to believe in any of them so let me prove to you from the Bible that this is true but I want to read one verse for you in proverbs 18 in verse 13 it says he that answereth the matter before he heareth it it is folly and shame unto Him so if you already made up your mind about what I just told you before I told you any scripture that's a shameful thing to do I want you to keep an open mind keep your eyes open read what I'm tellin you you're gonna go to each verse with me and if I'm not a hundred percent clear if you are not dead sure because I'm preaching two sermons on this each sermon is different I have twelve pages of Scripture I'm gonna prove to you without a shadow of a doubt that the earth is flat you know Hosea chapter four verse six you turn to Genesis chapter one it says my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge because thou has rejected knowledge I will also reject thee that thou shalt be no priest to me seeing thou has forgotten the law of God I will forget thy children so the Lord has shown me this to be true and science proves this without a doubt and I'll show you that as we go through but if I don't preach about this because I know how every single person in the movement feels about this I've seen every pastor in the movement publicly you know just announce flat-earthers make them feel stupid make them look stupid and most of the flat-earthers that are commenting you're very angry you know they're not going about it the right way they don't have the scripture I have the scripture so let's go to Genesis chapter 1 and look in verse 6 it says God said let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters and let it divide the waters from the water so this is creation what happened is there was water and God put a firmament between it that's the first picture I have on my list you see that dome you see that dome I'm going to explain to you what that is through Scripture that is the firmament and everything is within the firmament not out in the universe let me prove that to you and it said in verse 7 and God made the firmament and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament so you see that there's waters which we have under the firmament sea land that's under the firmament then there's waters also above keep that in mind above this firmament what is firmament mean well firm firmament the the first word firma actually just means solid and mint is just the end of a noun so it just means solid thing but let me prove to you from the Bible what it is go to Ezekiel chapter 10 in verse 1 Ezekiel chapter 10 and verse 1 you're gonna turn there with me and we're gonna learn what the firmament is so if you look if you look in Ezekiel chapter 10 in verse 1 it says then I looked and behold in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as were a sapphire stone as the appearance of the likeness of a throne so above the Chairman's is God's throne and there's a firmament above them and it says as it were a sapphire stone the appearance and the likeness of a throne I believe that to be describing the throne itself not the firmament turn to Revelation chapter 4 so keep that in mind the reason I showed you that verse is so that you can see that there's a firmament above the head of the cherubims where God's throne is where God's throne is it's describing a firmament under him right you see that the firmament is under it so I'm going to show you what a firmament actually is you're in Revelation chapter 4 Revelation chapter 4 look in verse 6 and it says in verse 6 and before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal and in the midst of the throne round about the throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind so what is the firmament it's a sea of glass it is described by the Bible the word itself actually does mean solid thing but according to the God's Word it's a sea of glass and that actually makes sense when you look at Genesis chapter 1 you need something that is hard to divide water from water and then turn to job chapter 37 I'm gonna make you come even if I'm just reading one verse I want you to go there with me because this is something brand-new this is something that you may have not seen before so I'm telling you that the firmament is what divides the waters from the waters and it is essentially like a circular disc is what the earth is with a dome on top of it and this dome is glass not maybe not what we think of as glass but you know God created a solid thing you're in job chapter 37 look in verse 18 job 37 verse 18 it says pass that with him spread out the sky which is strong and as molten looking glass so the firmament is glass it's as molten looking glass the firmament was under the throne that sea of glass and it is also what divides the waters from the waters this actually is true turn to the second page in your packet so I gave you each a packet if you don't have a packet please share with the person next to you or behind you so there Justin you have one right okay so what you're seeing here is a printout from Wikipedia this is a printout from Wikipedia and remind you mind you I'm describing I'm describing the firmament so what happened in there's something called Operation Dominic and if you look at the right you see that little that explosion at the right there that explosion on the right it says Dominic Chama I want you to keep an eye on that you see that so what happened is if you looked at the last sentence in the first paragraph it says the Thor missile was used to lift warheads into near space to conduct high-altitude nuclear explosion tests these shots were collectively called Operation fishbowl so what happened was the government when they started making missiles that were powerful enough that they thought they could break through the sea of glass they during the Cold War used the Cold War as a tactic for exploding high-altitude missiles to try and break through what they already knew was the dome on the earth and I'm gonna prove all this to you that you the government has always known that the earth is flat it lies to us through TV through the media through movies it makes you believe the Earl that the world is a spinning ball hurtling through space like a marble but they even called it operation fishbowl like does that not make you feel any more like you're in a flat earth with a bowl on top they called it operation fishbowl and it was to shoot missiles into into space because they thought they had the power to finally break through the firmament and actually what happens if you read the rest of the article these missiles would hit up at a certain altitude and then light would shine all the way to the other hemisphere and the reason that was is because they were hitting that glass and the glass was reflecting it all the way across the sky it's not some globe earth where they're just trying why would they just shoot a missile in the air to see how high it can blow up like are they just playing with rubber bands like they're doing it for a reason and they called it operation fishbowl for a reason and also their original name was Dominic Jarrah and if you see on your packet it goes by describe what Dominic Charma actually means Dominic is a Roman from the late Roman italic named Dominic as' and it means belonging to God and then that word Chama is a fixed massive irregular inequivalent shell so they originally called it the shell belonging to God but then they just termed it Operation fishbowl and that is them trying to fire at the firmament so let's go into Genesis chapter 7 Genesis chapter 7 I'm going to help you see even more that there is a firmament above us and how God has created this earth Genesis chapter 7 if you look in verse 11 Genesis 7 look in verse 11 it says in the six hundredth year of Noah's life in the second month the seventeenth day of the month the same day were all the foundation the Fountains of the great deep broken up and the windows of heaven were opened so you know some people will just look at this figuratively but when you realize that the earth is flat you start to see the Bible a lot more literally everything starts to be more literal stars falling to the earth the Sun and the moon being within the firmament will make a lot more sense when we start going over how the Sun and the moved circulate the earth not the other way around we do not circle the Sun that is false that's a false teaching so what's happening here is when he's opening the windows of heaven remember we said the firmament was dividing the waters from the waters so when he's opening the windows of heaven what is coming down the waters that he had divided that's how he's able to flood the entire earth how do you flood a ball earth that's spending like a tennis ball have you ever seen a wet Ten and you throw it and all of the water comes off of it as it's spinning well they say the reason that that the water doesn't leave the earth is because of gravity but if gravity is strong enough to hold in trillions of tons of water to the earth but a balloon can fly a bird can leave the earth at any point you don't have to feel like you're being pulled down at every second but trillions of tons of water are held to the earth does that make any sense what actually is happening is it's called density so anything that is more dense than air will sink in air anything that's more dense in water will sink in water why do you think why is gravity stopping you from let's say you know how Isaac Newton you know got hit on the head with an apple that was because the Apple was more dense than the air and he got hit if he was in water that Apple would have stopped right on the water why is the Apple not going through the water if it's gravity pulling it down to the center because it's not more dense than the water it's just a simple matter of density they try and make gravity seem like the all-encompassing thing and that's why they say because of gravity we can have multi multiple universes because of gravity we can have all these things happening why is it yet there's no observable form of gravity on earth there is no object massive enough to have other objects come cling to it in the way that the Sun does they say that the Sun is so heavy that the earth and the moon and all the planets circle around it but if it's if that is the case why is that not observable anywhere on the planet you cannot see that case anywhere and if the gravity of the Moon is strong enough to bring the tides in and out why is what why would that ever happen if the moon is has less mass than the earth shouldn't the thing that has more mass be bringing the gravity to it not the thing that has less mass bringing the gravity towards its way it doesn't make any sense their logic doesn't make any sense and the pictures that you see if speights the pictures that you see of all these planets and all these galaxies nASA has admitted that they're all fake they're CGI and they say they have to be CGI because they want you to believe a lie they want you to believe that these things are fake and let me just tell you satellites there's got to be the stupidest thing have you ever seen a satellite doesn't it just look like r2d2 like it's just they just they're messing with you they're messing with you they say the satellites radio spin around the earth in the thermosphere the thermosphere is 2500 degrees Celsius according to their science and the the satellites are made of titanium it burns at 1600 degrees it melts they lie to you they just mess with your mind they say it's made of gold the gold has to even lower melting point twenty twelve hundred degrees it's like embarrassing some of the things that they're willing to do and I'm gonna show you some pictures from NASA of how they just completely and blatantly lie to our face but they make you to believe that anybody that tells you differently it's a crazy person but I'm not crazy I hope not so go to the second Peter chapter three second Peter chapter three remember we're talking about the earth and the water and how the firmament is dividing the water from the water look in 2nd Peter chapter 3 verse 5 it says for this they willingly are ignorant of that by the Word of God the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the water so what's that word there to use there to describe the earth standing the earth is standing out of the water and in the water that's describing the division of the waters from the firmament but there's a reason he says the word standing because it's not rotating because it's not spinning because it's not hurtling through space like a marble and that's just the biggest lie I've ever heard and in Genesis chapter one do go to 2nd Corinthians chapter 12 2nd Corinthians chapter 12 in Genesis chapter 1 verse 8 it says God called the firmament heaven and the evening in the morning or the second day so God is calling the firmament heaven so that means the things below the firmament he'll also term heaven and the things above the firmament he'll term heaven and that's why if you've ever heard of pole ascending to the third heaven who's read that ascending to the third heaven there are three heavens if you think about it in a flat earth model so you have the heaven below the firmament that heaven above the firmament where the waters are an actual heaven is and then there's a third heaven where God sits because remember there's a firmament dividing God's throne from the Angels below him right because we went over that earlier so that's the third heaven but if you believe in the globe earth theory there's four heavens because mind you you have the earth then space they term the second heaven and then the third heaven would be the area below God's throne and then the fourth heaven would be where God sits because they always forget that there's a firmament abiding God's throne from under heaven let me prove that to you go to second Corinthians chapter 2 and verse 12 it says in verse 2 I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago whether in the body I count it cannot tell or whether out of the body I cannot tell God knoweth such a one caught up to the third heaven and I knew such a man whether caught up in whether in the body or out of the body I cannot tell God knoweth how that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words which is not lawful for a man to utter so he's caught up into paradise and he's caught up into the third heaven hearing unspeakable words I believe those words were from God I believe that he was hearing these words from the Lord and if you turn into Ezekiel chapter 1 I will show you that there are three heavens Ezekiel chapter one I'm gonna show you that there are three heavens the heaven that we visibly see which is the stars the moon the Sun all within the firmament the heaven above the firmament which has the waters and where the angels are according to scripture and then the heaven above that which is where God's throne is the third heaven so in Ezekiel chapter 1 and verse 22 it says the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was the color of the terrible Christel so what's that firmament describing again it's the terrible crystal that collapse that we were talking about stretched over their heads above and above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne as the appearance of a sapphire stone so that remember we were talking about the throne being a sapphire stone in the firmament below it being that glass so you got the crystal than the sapphire stone that's that third heaven because mind you the only other place the second heaven could be would be that between the two firmaments because you have the earth's firmament then the firmament dividing god's throne that makes one two three heavens where paul is hearing the unspeakable things and it says and I saw the cut in verse 27 I saw the color of amber and as the appearance of fire roundabout within it and the appearance of his loins even upward from the appearance of his loins downwards as it were the appearance of fire and it had brightness round about and he goes on to describe the Lord so turn to Psalm chapter 19 Psalm 19 mind you I have 12 pages of Scripture I've only taught you about the firmament so far there is undoubtable proof in God's Word that this is actually the correct depiction of the earth Psalm chapter 19 in Psalm chapter 19 in verse 1 it says the heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork so handiwork is only used one time in the Bible and it describes something that you would use your hands to create like a sea of molten glass if if the heavens are declaring the glory of God because the Sun and the moon and the stars have their own glory you know the light but the firmament is showing his handiwork that's him creating something over the heavens the firmament that's what that is so now let's go into Revelation chapter 6 and I'm gonna show you that the earth is flat according to Scripture not a spinning ball but before we do that turn to Revelation chapter 6 I want you to go back to your packet look in your packet we're going to look at number three the third page look in your packet to page number three these are actual depictions from NASA of what the earth has looked like over the years these are literally from NASA released to the public looked in 1975 see that big massive thing at clouds but then you can see a little bit of content continent under it look at 1997 you see the size all the way to the right you see the size of that continent 1997 the size but then look at 2012 right here right right in the the third row over in the bottom look how big that continent got the Earth's the same size but that continent grew a lot didn't it it grew a lot over the course of the years right but then look at 2002 a completely new size you have the right here you this is where the United States would be and then 2015 you can't even really see a continent and then 2007 you're almost able to see every continent and the one in the one picture so their pictures are changing from year to year they're never taking it they're never the same they never look the same they never they never match along the the earth doesn't look the same look at the colors the colors don't match the sizes never match the earth is always the same size but everything in it is just a mess because God's allowing them to just mess up do strong delusion and everybody just believes it they're flat out they flat out just believe it and turn to Revelation chapter 6 and they never show any stars in the background I want you to always keep that in mind there's never any stars behind the earth there's never any stars behind the moon because they always forget to put them in there but they say there's infinite amount of stars in the universe and if there was an infinite amount of stars in the universe you would only see light when you looked up you would only see light when you looked up no matter how long it takes the light to get here the lights are already here they're saying our universe is remind you you have to believe in the Big Bang Theory to believe this is true because the light is coming from millions of light years in the past so when you're seeing this light according to them it was millions of years ago that you saw that well that is coming now that Sun could be exploded by now that Sun could be gone but you're seeing the light coming from it and they say there's an infinite i'll go over the exact numbers but they say there's almost an infinite amount of stars in the universe and if that was true you would see nothing but light everywhere there would be no spot there would be no light but there's only and when you look it's funny if you do like a time-lapse of the stars you always see the same exact stars but if you're traveling through space at 515 thousand miles an hour all round the Sun at a thousand miles an hour while you've seen the same stars every single year at the same exact time it doesn't make any sense it's foolish so in Revelation chapter 6 look in verse 14 it says and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together and every mountain and Island were moved out of their places and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the mighty men and every bondman and every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains and said unto the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb so what did it just say departed as a scroll when rolled together the heavens remember the heavens in the firmament so once the firmament is departed as a scroll roll together not you know the spinning ball earth where it doesn't matter where the parts only half the earth is gonna see him but when the snows heavens depart as a scroll every eye season every bondman every free man sees him and they see his throne so that means both firmaments were rolled apart because remember there's still a permanent underthrown so the heavens departed as a scroll as is rolled together the firmament opens and obviously when the firmament opens and the other permanent opens you can see God because he's right above you he's not like some weird generation away he's not in some multi universe why would God create a tiny little earth and make you one of a billion everything he does has purpose the Sun has a purpose the moon has a purpose Stars have purposes why would he make millions of galaxies and make you nothing the earth is the smallest it doesn't make any sense it's stupid they want you to believe a lie so that you don't believe in God do you know how many more people believe in God a--they if you knew you lived on a flat earth and that you knew God was right above you literally right above you there's a firmament on top of the earth above that or the waters that divided and then above that is God's throne God's right there that's why when we get to the circle of the earth and he's looking down upon us like grasshoppers is because he literally is and he's right there and he can take a lot more accountable if he's right above us dirt turned to Revelation chapter 1 and verse 7 revelation 1 verse 7 some people will say oh every eyes going to see him because we all have TV no there's plenty of Hoarders out in you know in nowheres land that had no TV no anything every eye will see him Revelation chapter 1 behold in verse 7 he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him every eye and they also which pierced him in all the kindred of the earth shall wail because of him even so amen on a ball earth if he's coming with the clouds he better time that correctly because that turth is spinning real quick and only a quarter of the earth is really gonna see him honestly if it's a ball earth and you're spinning not every eyes gonna see him but every eye will see him when the heavens depart and he comes straight down and it'll be their turns of Janus Daniel chapter 4 Daniel chapter 4 verse 11 Daniel chapter 4 verse 11 Daniel for verse 11 so in Daniel chapter 4 is talking about a tree and it says the tree grew and was strong in the height thereof reached unto heaven so the height is reaching above the clouds unto heaven it's going very high up and then it says and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth so we'll go over the fact that the earth actually does have ends and then it's not a ball it is actually all held in together but it's showing there that if something is tall enough or high enough you can see it from every end of the earth if there is a tree large enough obviously the base would have to be very very wide to make it all the way to heaven and God's Word is saying the sight thereof and the sight there up to the end of the earth you can every eye can see it in the same way that every eye would be able to see the glory of Jesus when he comes down it's gonna be literal everything in the Bible assume it's literal unless it's you know perhaps to be metaphorical turn to generous Genesis chapter 11 oh I'm gonna read a verse from you from Matthew chapter 8 but you turn to Genesis Levin I mean Matthew chapter 4 and it says in Matthew 4 verse 8 again the devil taketh them up to an exceeding high mountain and show with him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them so some people say you know well obviously it's a miracle because you know you can't see all the kingdoms of the earth but why would it say an exceeding high mountain and why would it say showing him all the kingdoms of the earth because the mountain has to be extremely high if you can see across a flat earth all the kingdoms of the earth and the glory of them so you have even on a very very clear day on a very very high mountain you could see a lot of land you could see all the kingdoms at that time and I believe there's a reason that says an exceeding high mountain it would have just said he just took him up and he saw everything there's a reason he brought him to an exceeding high mountain to show him all the kingdoms of the earth so you're in Genesis chapter 11 looking in verse 1 and the whole the whole earth was of one language and of one speech and it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that they found a plain in the land of Shinar and they dwelt there and they said one to another go to let us make brick and burn them thoroughly and they had brick for stone and slime they had for mortar and they said go to let us build us a city and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven and let us make a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth we'll get into the face of the earth and how that actually means a literal face of the earth and how God only uses the word face describing flat surfaces but face of the earth and it says in verse 6 the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men builded and the Lord said Behold the people are one they have all of one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do so this was a foolish task and this was something stupid and if this was unaccomplished able on a spinning ball earth then God wouldn't have came down God wouldn't have made it a problem and some people say you know people in the Old Testament always believed that the earth was a sphere they say that to make their theory theme seem more clear but if they think the earth is a sphere why would they try and build a tower unto heaven where are they trying to go what are they trying to do they want to go on to heaven and they'd say that whose top may reach unto heaven and let us make us a name lest we be scattered so they knew that they could build up they knew that something was above them and they knew because pretty much everybody knew until the 1600s until the last 500 years or so that the earth was flat it's just more recently where they could easily plague us from the newspapers from movies and TVs that everybody just believes a lie from birth what's the first thing you're seen when you walk into any any school anything anywhere even churches today a big globe that's the first thing it's on pretty much even half the pastor's in this movement I have a big globe as their background they don't even realize they're perpetuating a lot you might as well just show the evolution of monkey - man all the way down the hallway because you're just pushing a lot and it's not in Scripture so turn to Genesis chapter 1 and in verse 9 I'm going to show you that the Sun Moon and stars are within the firmament they are not we are not spinning around them we are not you know just hurtling through space and they're everywhere no they're all within the firmament look in verse 9 and said gods God said let the waters under the heaven be gathered together into one place remind remind you there was waters below the heaven and above the heaven be gathered into one place and let the dry land appear and it was so and God called the dry land earth and then he the gathering together of the waters called he seas and God saw that it was good and God said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and for years so when your earth is spinning continually and you're seeing the same exact stars then I don't know how that's possible in their Theory the reason that God created stars and the Sun and the moon was for signs and for seasons and you know the Sun was given to give heat on the earth and the moon was given for a light by night look at verse 15 he said let them be for lights in the firmament in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth and it was so and God made two great lights so the moon is a great light people assume who's heard that the landing on the moon was faked has anybody heard that most people actually believe that but they still believe in the spirit the reason the moon landing was faked is because you can't land on a light it's not possible that's why turn to chapter page number 4 in your package page number 4 in your packet is a picture of nope sorry turn to page number wait for it six-six page number six there should be numbers on it see the blue sky you see the moon this is the page you're trying to look for see the blue sky and then you see the moon if the moon had a shade on it that would be black you wouldn't be able to see blue sky behind it that's a fake when they show you the moon in space this is what the moon that really looks like it's a light it's not something you can land on that's why you can see through it because it's a light and God has given it to have different seasons for different seasons so you know when he calls it a new moon he means the light is fully shining but when it's a lesser moons it's not shining as much that's why you can see blue sky behind the moon because it's in the firmament it's in the sky it's within our own enclosed system if this was the shade of the Sun this would have to be black because that's what a shadow is black so you're in Genesis chapter one it says he created two great lights the greater light the Sun to rule the day the lesser light to rule the night he made the stars also and God set them in the firmament I don't know how many times he can say it but he said it at least three times so far in the firmament of the heaven to divide to give light on upon the earth so reasons for the Sun and the moon to give light upon the earth and to rule and in verse 18 it says to rule over the day and over the night and to divide the light from the darkness and God saw that it was good turn to mark chapter 13 I'm gonna proof prove to you without a shadow of a doubt that the moon is a light and not a terrestrial plane that you can land on because mind you when it was land God called it earth he would have said a light and in Earth because when it was land he called it earth but he's calling it a light look in mark chapter 13 and verse 24 and it says in those days after the tribulation the Sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not give her light the moon's own light if the moon was giving its the light from the Sun it would be the sun's light it's her own light opened up to page number five in your package this is a literal picture from NASA that they released to the public and in their fake CGI imaging right here you can see that they're taking this picture from behind their false moon in their false world and the sun is shining on them on the earth but it forgot to shine on the moon it would forget right here there's no Sun here there's no light here this was released to the public there would be light here if the Sun was behind it there should be this should be illuminated its darkened because it's fake and though the moon's a light so turn to Revelation chapter 21 Revelation chapter 21 and verse 23 revelation 21:23 reads and the city had no need of the Sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of God did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof so why would it mention the moon as a light if it wasn't giving it off its own light you wouldn't need that that extra wording there it doesn't make sense 1st Corinthians chapter 15 1st Corinthians chapter 15 and verse 41 we're gonna look at verse 41 first Corinthians 15 verse 41 it says there is one glory of the Sun it's talking about the light shining from and it's talking about the light given off of it and that's why I talk describes the glory of God it's talking about light there's one glory of the Sun and another glory of the Moon Moon own light own light another glory not the same glory and then it says also for and another glory of the stars so the stars have also have their own light for one star different from another star in glory so different brightnesses different lights Ezekiel chapter 32 and mind you if the moon is a light and not a plane everything you've ever been told us a lot everything you've ever been told there's a lot because the moon can't have gravity if it's a if it's a lesser light and actually the moon and the Sun or the same size why would they look the same exact size and be exactly the perfect distance away from each other to look the exact same size if this if the Sun is billions of times bigger than the earth or Miller or however many times bigger it would have to be the perfect distance away and the moon would have to be the perfect distance away for them to be the same exact size it doesn't make sense they're the same size one's just a light for night and the other is a light for day there in the firmament turn to Ezekiel chapter 32 verse 7 verse 7 says when I shall put the out I will cover the heaven and make the stars thereof dark and I will cover the Sun with a cloud and the moon shall not give her light all the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee and I shall set darkness upon the land so the reason he says it will be darkness because the moon will not give her light the moon is a light Jeremiah I'm just gonna beat this right into the ground Jeremiah 31 verse 35 I actually had to cut out about 40 more verses of this just because it was too repetitive but I really need to show you this Jeremiah chapter 31 verse 35 Jeremiah 31 verse 35 I'm gonna let you all get there Jeremiah 31 verse 35 reads thus saith the Lord which giveth the Sun for a light by day and the ordinances keep in mind ordinances is like a setting of something you know you set ordinances so the ordinance the Sun and the moon it would be the rotation thereof and it says the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night so the moon is a light and the stars are a light for night which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar the Lord of Hosts is his name and then Isaiah 13 turn to Isaiah 13 there's a last verse we'll go over with the moon Shelton cause her shall not cause her light to shine Isaiah chapter 13 in verse 10 it reads for the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light the Sun shall be darkened in his going forth and the moon shall not cause her light to shine the moon's light her light the moon gives off its own light and it is not a plane you can land on that's why the moon landing was a fake and that's why the guy looked like a nutjob when he was trying to explain how he land on the moon because you can't land on a light it's just not possible it doesn't make sense turn to Genesis chapter 2 Genesis chapter 2 Genesis chapter 2 verse 1 reads thus the heavens and the earth were finished and all the host of them so all the hosts are there of them if you believe in the globe model would include the universe so it's done right but if you believe the earth is a globe spinning through space it's not done you have to believe that the universe is ever expanding that's why it's spinning through space that's why our galaxy is constantly according to science traveling through space because it's expanding into nothing but God says we're finished everything's finished everything's done there's no more creating happening there's no more expanse happening it's done the heavens and the earth are finished and it's an enclosed system and it's all right here and science will also tell you that they know the radius of the earth right because you need to know the radius to calculate the curvature so they know the radius of the earth they know how wide the earth is in their spirit in their sphere model turn to job chapter 38 job chapter 38 I'm gonna prove to you that you can't find out the radius of the earth because it's a flat earth and God says you can't find it out and I believe them job 38 verse 4 it says where was thou when I laid the foundations of the earth declare if thou hast understanding who laid the measures thereof if thou notice if thou knowest or who has stretched the line upon it hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth declare if thou knows it all so God is saying you can't radius of the earth you won't find out the radius of the earth because we're not trying to measure a radius mind you where it's not a sphere where and I'm sure maybe we could measure from endpoint to endpoint but they're not gonna let us do that because you know they all they all are pushing this globe theory but that's still not the radius up and down you know we'll never find that out we'll never know that and it says who has stretched a line upon it I'll go into that more but a line is a unit of measurement or a way of measuring a straight flat fixed plane you don't use a line I'll prove that to you from the Bible that you don't use a line to measure something that's curved you don't use a line to measure something that is curved turn to first Timothy chapter 6 I'm sorry turn to Isaiah chapter 44 I'll read this verse for you Isaiah chapter 44 verse 13 this is in first Timothy chapter 6 verse 20 teams Timothy keep that which is committed to thy trust avoid profane and vain babblings and opposition's of science falsely so called so if science is going against scripture we need to go against science but actually the real science proves the earth is flat real science proves that the earth is flat and I mean I know for sure I started realizing this when I used to live at home in mattatuck so I used to live in a place called Mattituck which is at the tip of Long Island and if you looked across on a clear day I could see the shore of Connecticut and the shore of Connecticut is about 17 miles away and I started to question you know because I was a physics major when I went to college for my first year and I started to question the curvature and I know I heard you know all from the media it's just a mirage the two Brad mirages are upside down and they're supposed to be inverted so you can't say that something's a mirage from the curvature so I start to question it I was and I did the math I found out I said you know 17 miles away mind you you know the earth dispersed the curve 8 inches per mile squared so 17 miles squared times 8 inches divided by 12 it's about 192 feet of curvature you're supposed to see so I shouldn't be able to see the show let alone any buildings in Connecticut but it was clear as day even with the knot and then just get binoculars then it's even more clear it's easy that you're just looking at a flat surface who saw that that picture of Chicago I think it was on the news where they showed Chicago from almost 40 miles away and the news was trying to explain it like oh you're seeing a mirage mirages are inverted Chicago would have been upside down you were actually seeing they were proving that the earth is flat because 40 miles away is a very very long distance and the earth should have curved I didn't do the math for this one but at least 400 feet maybe 600 feet probably more than that I didn't even do the math yet but it's just a big lie it's always been a lie and some people will say well what about sailboats you know when you see a sailboat going that sailboat it drops right no it doesn't get binoculars she'll just see the bottom of it right there but I'll just prove to you why that happens so when you're looking at something picture you're looking down the hallway you ever see a hallway you know that every single border is the same right it's equidistant this way and equidistant this way what happens to your vision as it goes farther away it looks like the top is coming down right it looks like the top is getting lower but it's not getting lower it's the same height if you walked all the way over there it would be the same height but all the converging lines come to your field of vision so when you see a sailboat or a boat going away from you it looks like it's getting lower it looks like the top is dipping down well what's actually happening is that all your converging lines of your vision they're coming together and if you would just take a camera that can zoom or binoculars that could see farther you could be able to see the bottom of that boat there was no dip there was no curvature there was nothing it's just the field of your vision that's why when you look at a hallway all four sides are coming together in the top of your vision it's just it's just the way your mind processes things it has nothing to do with the fact that something's curving because people online you can just go look people just zoom in like they'll see a boat you'll be like oh it's gone and then they just use their camera and just zoom in a little bit and it's odd it's right there it's still right there because it's so simple it's just easy to prove that the earth is flat it's so easy to prove the earth is flat your and Isaiah chapter 44 look in verse 13 it says the carpenter stretched stretcheth out his rule he markets it out with a line he fitted it with planes so remember we were talking about a line how to measure with a line well when you're stretching out your rule and you're fitting it with a plane plane is a flat surface so when God was talking about measuring the earth with a line he was measuring a flat surface and what does he used to measure a curved surface what would God call that look in the next verse it says and he and it says and he marked it out with a compass and he marked out the figure of a man so to mark with a compass that's what God would use to measure curvature but he's just measuring it with a line that's why we went over that verse before and in Joshua chapter 6 you don't have to turn there says verse 3 and ye shall compass the city all you men of war so when they were circling the city God would describe the earth as he would describe the earth has compass if it was round but every time he describes measuring the earth he describes it by stretching a line upon it because it's flat and it's not round Jeremiah chapter 31 verse step 37 says thus saith the Lord if the heaven above can be measured and the foundations of the earth stretched out beneath I will also cast out all of the seed of Israel so the science saying I know the radius of the earth God is saying you can't measure that God is telling you you can never measure how high heaven is you will never be able to figure that out but science tells us we can because they're lying if God says we can't measure it then we can't and it says in proverbs 25 3 the heaven for height the earth for depth and the heart of Kings is unsearchable so you'll never know how far the firmament is up and you'll never know how deep hell is below us because you know how everybody says and the Bible teaches that hell is below us but isn't that such a finite place for hell you know you got billions of souls going to hell if you believe the earth is a globe you only got so much space to put all those souls we got to think of stuff more literally as a church you know if it's there's nothing under us if it's an enclosed system and hell is beneath God's got a lot of space to put help he's got a lot of space for all those souls and then you're going to turn to Ezekiel chapter 40 ezekiel chapter 40 so in Ezekiel chapter 14 verse 5 it says and behold a wall on the outside of the house roundabout and in the man's hand a measuring Reed of six cubits long six cubits long by the cubit and a high in breadth so the measure the breadth of the building one read and the height thereof and then turn to Ezekiel chapter 45 so the measuring read is six cubits long one read is six cubits I'm just gonna use some science here real quick one read is six cubits turn to Ezekiel chapter 45 look in verse 1 it says moreover when he shall divide by lot the land for inheritance you shall offer an oblation unto the Lord a holy portion of the land the length show the length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand Reed's so he's using 25,000 Reed's to measure the length of land but a reed is a straight object I'll read you would use to measure something flat and six cubits is the length of a reed times that by 25,000 Reed's that's 225,000 feet which is 42.6 miles that they're measuring with the formula for the curvature of the earth the earth would have dropped 1,200 feet by then you wouldn't use a reed to measure 1,200 feet of curvature and needing an account for that in any of his measurements because you have to account for curvature when you're actually measuring out distances that's why I could talk to anybody that you know lays track for trains they never account for curvature because it doesn't exist it's no curvature in the earth they only count for you know going up and down hills there's no curvature there's actually if you actually do the math there should be a lot of curvature when you're doing 40 miles 15 miles hundreds of miles you're not buying more track for hundreds of miles when you should be if there's a lot of curvature and in my next sermon because mind you this is a two-parter I got to put this to bed my next sermon this is the end of this one I'm going to cover the earth is a circle not a sphere the earth is fixed and not rotating the earth is a flat surface though we kind of touched on it here the earth has ends which I'll go over and the Sun moves not the earth and I verses that prove that without a doubt and I'll just close this in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father I thank you so much for all the people you have brought here today lord I pray that they will see your truth in your word I pray that we will stop believing lives of science falsely so called and I pray that you will work in the hearts of everybody that hears this sermon to believe your word as truth and we thank you so much we pray in Jesus name Amen okay so one thing I forgot to mention in my last sermon was I want you to turn to Genesis chapter 1 look in verse 9 it says God said let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place and let the dry land appear and it was so so this is Earth being created and God called the dry land earth you see that says dry land earth and the gathering together of the waters called he seas and God saw that it was good and God said let the lights let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons so what was created first it was the earth the earth was created first and then he created the lights the Stars the Sun and it says let them be for signs and for seasons of her years and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth and God made two great lights so he didn't even create the Sun and the moon yet so now he's creating the Sun and the moon the greater light to rule the day the lesser light to rule the night and he made the stars also and God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth and to rule over the day and over them over the night and God saw that it was good so what happened first was on the second day God created the firmament and then the third day God created earth under the firmament in the firmament and then the fourth day God creates the Sun and the moon so what was the earth rotating around before God created it what was the earth rotating around before God created the Sun it wasn't rotating around anything because he created the earth first created the earth firmament and then he put the lights in it and I just wanted to show you that before we get into the circle of the earth so you just have a general idea that God created the earth first and then the Sun in the moon it just wouldn't make sense why would why did wouldn't he create the Sun first and then the earth and have the earth spin around the Sun it makes more sense that you create the earth first and then the Sun spinning around the earth so let's get into the circle of the earth all right so I hope you still have your packet if not grab your packet from below you and if you haven't if you're watching this online you haven't seen part number one it's important to watch part number one and get the foundations of the message so we're gonna start in Isaiah chapter 40 and if you have your packet with you we're gonna look at Isaiah 40 next to verse 22 now I want you to put your packet next to your Bible and on the first page of your packet it goes over something in verse 22 I and Isaiah chapter 40 and verse 22 it goes over something very specific and it says in verse 22 it is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth talking about God and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in so look at your packet this is the Flat Earth model of the universe well I don't like to call it a universe because it's an enclosed system so the Flat Earth model of the world this is the circle if God is sitting upon the circle of the earth he's sitting up here remember we've talked about God being above the firmament he's sitting upon the circle of the earth and looking down and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers looking down at the circle us as grasshoppers we're as grasshoppers to him on the spinning ball earth he's looking down and things are just spinning in front of his face things are just going everywhere and things are more real in literal in the Bible he is literally looking down upon us and it says he that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in so when you think of a tent what do you think of something that's on a flat surface that is casing over it it is over the earth this is a tent the heavens are as a tent and it says to dwell in because he's talking about stretching out the heavens and spreading them as a twelve to dwell in we are dwelling in that tent that tent is this firmament and everything is within this enclosed system it is all within here and we are sitting within and a tent is something you would use on a flat surface they used that terminology God uses this terminology for a good reason you wouldn't put a tent on a ball you would wrap a blanket around a ball or you would do something else around a ball but a tent is something that you set pillars and you establish it and then everything else is within it so turn to Isaiah chapter 13 so I just wanted to go over why the earth is a circle not a sphere because some people use that verse that he sitteth upon the circle of the earth and they'll say see that's the word that's sphere that's a sphere or in Hebrew circle means sphere you know they just want to go back they want to go back to the Hebrew and just say no it's just a circle and this is a circle this is the circle of the earth it's it's a flat disc and he's looking down upon it but it's not a sphere it's a circle and then if you're in Isaiah chapter 13 verse 13 I want to show you that the earth is in a fixed position it is not rotating around the Sun it is not spinning through the galaxy is not being just propelled into nothingness it's in a fixed position look in verse 13 of Isaiah 13 it says therefore I will shake the heavens in order to shake something it's usually stationary right I will shake the heavens and the earth shall remove out of her place in the wrath of the Lord of Hosts and in the day of his fear anger fierce anger so her place is showing that the earth has a place a position of space that it is set in the rotating earth where it's just going everywhere and you know it's going through space and it's traveling around the Sun which is traveling around the galaxy there's no fixed place for Earth but this isn't a fixed place turn to first chronicles chapter 16 first chronicles chapter 16 I'm just going to go through a bunch of verses that show that the earth is in a fixed position and it is stationary and not rotating or spinning first chronicles chapter 16 and verse 30 it says fear before him all the earth the world also shall be stable that it be not moved so the world is stable it's established and it's not gonna be moved turn to Psalm chapter 33 Psalm chapter 33 I want you to look in verse 8 Psalm 33 and verse 8 it says let all the earth fear the Lord let the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him for he spake and it was done he commanded and it stood fast so he's talking about the inhabitants of the world and he's saying he spake and it was done everything was created and he commanded and it stood fast when something is staying it stood it's in one place and when it's fast it's fast sinned it's staying in that one place turn to Psalm 93 which we just read Psalm 93 which we just read in verse 1 it says the Lord reigneth he is closed clothed with majesty the Lord is clothed with strength wear with you a girded himself the world also is established that it cannot be moved so it's describing the strength of the Lord it's describing that he is clothed with majesty and clothed with strength which wherewith he had girded himself and he's talking about thing the Lord created the world also established and it cannot be moved it's in one fixed place it's not rotating or spinning turns of psalm 104 verse 5 psalm 104 in verse 5 verse 5 reads who laid the foundation of the earth that it should not be removed for ever so the foundations of the earth is when you think of foundation you got to think of what it is built upon the earth itself so the foundation of the earth what it is what the earth is is mounted upon obviously we're going to go over the verse where it's mount upon nothing where our earth hangeth upon nothing but the foundation of the earth is not going to be removed I don't always use this verse because you know some people say that just the you know the earth itself is not going to be removed but when you're talking about the foundation of the earth the place and where it is standing that it should not be removed forever because it's immovable and it cannot be removed forever turn to Isaiah chapter 45 Isaiah chapter 45 and verse 18 it says in verse 18 in Isaiah 45 it says thus saith the Lord that created the heavens God Himself that formed the earth and made it he hath established it he created it not in vain for he formed it to be inhabited I am the Lord and there is no one else so in this verse what does it say it says that he created the earth not in vain he formed it to be inhabited and he's saying he's the Lord he made it he God Himself formed the earth and he made it he formed it not in vain so if he formed the earth not in vain and it was made to be inhabited the earth has a purpose it was made to be inhabited by us the Sun has a purpose it is made to give light upon the earth the moon has a purpose it is made to give light upon the earth when the Sun is not when where it's not with the saw because mind you they're spinning in the same direction around the earth so everything God created has a purpose he formed the earth for a reason for it to be inhabited why would he create a vast expanse of billions of galaxies billions of other planets billions of other stars if they have no purpose because they don't have a purpose they have no purpose if you believe that there's billions of other galaxies billions of other stars billions of other planets those things were created by science to deceive you to make it seem like there could be all their life out there to make it seem like God did not make us personal but he formed the earth for a reason so it would be inhabited by us as people you know so he could in so we could inhabit it nothing is vainly created you said he created it not in vain vain it just means vanity so if something's created in vain it doesn't have a purpose it's useless in the same way that other planets other galaxies other stars in millions of light-years away they're useless they're vanity they're created in vain for no reason the earth the Flat Earth system everything in our system has a purpose the sea has purposed the land has purpose the firmament itself has purpose the Sun and the moon and the stars within it have purpose other galaxies are under there they would be vanity they would be created in vain there's no purpose to them turn to job chapter 9 so I'm gonna go over a couple verses that talk about the earth being on pillars but this is more of I guess a theory that God puts forth about the earth being on pillars you know I don't have science to back this up just in the same way I don't have science to back up that there's a firmament in heaven we're trusting the Bible here so in job chapter 9 and verse 6 it says which shake it the earth out of her place so it's talking about God shaking the earth out of her place you know her stationary place that God has established for it and the pillars thereof tremble so the bible does talk about the earth on pillars and the pillars necessarily don't have to have a foundation because some people will say well if the earth has pillars then what about the Lord what about the earth being hung on nothing the earth hang upon nothing we'll go over that but just because the earth has pillars or of God's describes it you know the foundation doesn't mean it's those pillars are on anything so the earth can still be hung upon nothing and the pillars thereof can be also theoretical in the sense that this is the lord holding the earth up so turn to First Samuel chapter 2 First Samuel Chapter two I'm going to talk about these pillars a little more first samuel chapter 2 and verse 8 it says he raised it up the poor for samuel 2 and verse 8 he raiseth up the poor out of the dust and lifted up the beggar from the dunghill to set them upon among princes and to make them inherit the throne of glory for the pillars of the earth are the Lord's and he has set the world upon them so the pillars of the earth are the worlds are the lords and he has set the earth upon them so you know this could put forth the theory that there are pillars holding your pillars holding this Flat Earth up and the Lord has established them but what are those pillars on there on the you know the strength of God God is holding up everything God is the one that is holding up the earth the God is the reason that this earth is unmovable and and stable but the Lord is talking about the actual the Flat Earth being hung upon pillars which is also not possible on a globe earth because you know you're constantly spinning there's no stationary thing about it and there would be no pillars and in Psalm 75 we've turned to Psalm 75 it's the Lord that is actually holding the earth it is the Lord that's keeping the earth stationary it's the Lord that has established the earth and he created look in Psalm 75 and verse 3 it says in verse 3 of Psalm 75 it says the earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved I bear up the pillars of it so I was talking about the Lord bearing the pillars of the earth so the Lord holds the earth he bears up the pillars it is the Lord that is keeping the earth stationary when you think of pillars do you think of something that's established you think of something that is you know you would use pillars to hold up a building and a building is not something that's constantly in motion you wouldn't use pillars to hold up a car you wouldn't use pillars to hold up an airplane use pillars to hold up something that's established something that's stationary turn to job chapter 26 verse 7 job chapter 26 verse 7 and in job chapter 26 verse 7 talking about the Lord and he says he stretch it out the north over the empty place and hangeth the earth upon nothing so if you think of the north as the center of a flat earth and he's stretching out the north over the empty place you know because it's a circle and he's hanging the earth upon nothing so those pillars he's establishing them he's holding the earth he's keeping it fastened and that is literally hung upon nothing you can't say the pillars were hung upon something because the Lord that has established it and he's stretching out the north over an empty place stretching out the north over an empty place and hanging the earth upon nothing but in the heliocentric model of the earth the earth is hung upon the gravity of the Sun people say oh because it's spinning in space it's hung upon nothing but it actually if it's tied to the gravity of the Sun it is hung upon the Sun's gravity and it is hung upon the weight or the mass of the Sun and it's not hung upon nothing because it according to science it rotate the same distance every single year around the same exact thing and it's hung upon the gravity of the Sun so I just want to disprove that you know some people will say oh the earth is a ball because it's not hung upon anything but you know if you believe in gravity and you believe that gravity is holding up the holding the earth it is holding the earth in its rotation around the Sun but I believe that the Lord is holding up the earth and he has established it it is his to hold up in his whole days he's hanging it upon nothing he's hanging it upon nothing because it's established on his pillars you usually hang something from the top and he's hanging upon nothing he's holding it with his pillars and it says invert in job 38 verse 6 it says in verse 6 whereupon are the foundations they are fastened and who laid the cornerstone thereof he's talking about the world and he shot you know he's kind of rebuking job telling him all the things that he created all the things that he did and he's saying if you can answer this whereupon are the foundations of the there of the earth fastened where's the earth fixed where it is tell me where it is who laid the cornerstone which is something you would do for something that's established a cornerstone a building if Jesus is the cornerstone of our faith that has to be something fixed that has to be something in movable that has to be something you build upon if you're establishing a cornerstone of the earth you have to build upon that you have to have that established and that is stationary stuck fixed I'm gonna prove to you that the earth is a flat surface to go to Genesis chapter 1 Genesis chapter 1 so throughout the Bible almost 40 times the Bible we use the word faiths we use the word face to describe the face of the earth also the face of the sea and anytime the word face is used in the Bible it's actually talking about a flat surface so if you're in Genesis chapter 1 look at verse 29 it says and God said behold I have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the earth and retrieve which is which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall be for me so upon the face of the earth think of your own face so even when it describes your own face your face your face itself it's flat in the same way that the earth is flat it just has peaks and valleys and dips but it is this flat you wouldn't call your head flat you would call your head a sphere you would call your head something that is circular round you know something that is a sphere but you could consider your face as a the earth in the sense that if you're you know if you have a circular type face it would be a circle but it would also be a face in the sense that it's flat with just peaks and valleys like mountains you know dips in the sea everything it's still flat and the face of the the face of the land the face of the sea whenever God is using to describe that is talking about a flat surface and I want you to turn to number seven in your packet if you look in your packet we're gonna look at picture number seven so these are four different pictures and it's spanning over the course of almost 10 or 15 miles you can see here so this is at sea level and there's a reason it's called sea level because it's level the sea is not curving it's level completely throughout the world so this is at sea level you see that the horizon is flat and then you go up a little more this is a ground level the ground the horizon you see the horizon is flat and then you go over here this is a different part on the ground also a different part of the world you see how it's flat and then the top picture is above the clouds but you see how the horizon is also flat why is it flat as no matter no matter where you go no matter how high you go up on the earth and you can find these videos online I'm gonna make a documentary about this sermon these two sermons and I'm gonna show you video but why is it flat as you go higher and higher and higher it's because the earth is a flat surface so the horizon will raise rise with you and it will remain flat no matter what field of view you were seeing because remind you we talked about the we talked about how all the converging lines of your vision going down a hallway so the ground continues to look flat when it is flat and all the reason that the horizon will raise with you is because the way that you're looking you're continually just looking farther and farther distances away but it's always flat cousin flat surface if the earth was curved the higher you got the more curvature you would see because you're getting more and more farther away from a flat surface so when you're just looking in front of you everything looks flat and you shouldn't see that much curvature if you were on a curved earth yes but as you get higher or as you look farther and as you look broader like if you ever look at the sea you should see curvature you should begin to see that and especially when you get into higher buildings like you don't have to go flying to see this just go up to a hundred storey building go up to an 80 storey building a 40-story building and look out at the horizon it's going to remain flat to you because the rest of the earth is flat and it's rising with your with your vision it would curve the higher you got it would be even more curved it would curve even exponentially the higher you got because you could see farther distances and the farther distance you can see the more the earth curves eight inches per mile square remind you so the farther you can see the more to curve but as you can see by these pictures and as you should do next time you're in a tall building just look outside the horizon will always remain flat no matter what level you're at because the earth is flat turns in numbers chapter 22 numbers chapter 22 so remember how I described how your face was flat and how anytime the word face whether it be talking about the sea or the land is describing a flat surface look at numbers chapter 22 and verse 31 it says then the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam and he saw the angels the Lord standing in the way and the sword drawn in his hand and he bowed down his head and fell flat on his face if your face wasn't flat he wouldn't say flat on your face because the Bible is very literal so he did fall flat on his face whether he hit his nose first or not it's still a flat surface the law of the world the Bible is talking about the the face of the water the face of the land the face of everything is talking about face because it is flat as you continue on turn to Genesis chapter 7 Genesis 7 verse 23 Genesis chapter 7 verse 23 so if you look in Genesis 7 in verse 23 it says every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground so I was talking about everything in the earth right every living substance was on the face of the ground so I was talking about a flat surface and every living substance being on the face of it both man and cattle and creeping thing in the fal of heaven and they were destroyed from the earth and Noah remained alive and they that were with him in the ark turn to Genesis chapter 1 actually I'm sorry stay in Genesis 7 Genesis 7 look in verse 18 it says the waters prevailed and were increased increased greatly upon the earth and the ark went upon the face of the waters so the waters are increasing remember when when there was a flood and we're gonna get into the ends of the earth and what I believe is holding the earth in when the waters are increasing and everything is getting drowned and everybody is dying there is talking about the face of the waters a level faced plane that's that's how that works when the when the heavens are open and a flood is coming down and the earth is being flooded up that's how that works it doesn't work on a globe if you're spinning and you have these massive floods you know the water is going to be pulled 2 & 2 in which way the moon's gonna be pulling the shore back and forth you know you're gonna have all these gravity factors coming in and it just doesn't work when a ball is spinning that all the water can stay on a ball yet other things don't have to be forced down by that water that gravity should be so intense to hold the water in that it should be able to hold you to the they should be able to hold birds to the ground helium should not be able to rise and a helium balloon and the only reason that helium can rise in a helium balloon is because helium is less dense than air so if you fill up a balloon which has weight and is more dense than air it'll fall and it has nothing in it it will fall to the ground but you put enough helium in it it remove it spins out that balloon makes the density of that balloon lot less and less as you fill it and then at a certain point it will start floating but if you let out enough helium from that balloon and the weight of the balloon matches the with the with the helium in there and that density matches you'll have a balloon at equilibrium you ever seen a balloon that is just sitting right there that's just sitting in space the reason for that is is because of density not gravity so the density of inside the balloon the density of helium is a lot less than air it it counteracted with the weight of that balloon that it matched the air perfectly that's why it's equilibrium that's why that balloon is not going up or down because the density of the balloon plus the helium match the density of the air so it's not going up or down it's just staying perfectly at equilibrium that doesn't work on gravity it should be pulling it down no matter what it doesn't matter how much it weighs and then turn to zechariah chapter 9 let's go over the let's go over the ends of the earth the ends of the earth genesis chapter 1 and verse 2 says the earth was without form and void darkness was upon the face of the deep and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters so it's again talking about a level plane you're in Zechariah chapter 9 look in verse 10 so the Lord has established ends to the earth and I'm going to describe to you what these ends are and I believe them to be ice walls that surround the earth also known as Antarctica so remember when we're talking about this Flat Earth model on the globe Antarctica on the globe is at the bottom right so when you think of a globe you think of Antarctica at the bottom but when you think of the Flat Earth model remember the north is the top and if you squish the globe the North would be at the center right so what does an order becoming becomes the ends all the way around 360 degrees so their globe model it's actually false they make it seem like a continent but what it really is is it's the ends of the earth and the reason that those ice walls those ice shelves are so high it's because they're holding in the earth they're holding in the waters they're holding in everything and God has established it look at zechariah chapter 9 and verse 10 it says and i will cut off the chariot from Ephraim and the horse from Jerusalem and the battle bow shall be cut off and he shall speak he shall speak peace unto the heathen and his Dominion shall be from see even to sea and from the river even to the ends of the earth so God has established ends to earth it's not just a continuing full-on globe where there's no end you can literally if it's a globe you can go from one point around in a circle in a circle in a circle you can do that here on a flat earth model if you're going around the North Pole so you can do that but if you just fly straight if you're not you know turning you'll hit the end of the earth because there are ends and we're gonna go over a lot of verses that talk about this but this is just one it says from the river even to the end of the earth turn to job chapter 26 rare discriminate job chapter 26 verse 10 it says he had coppiced the waters with bounds job 26 verse 10 it says he hath toppest the waters with bounds until the day in the night come to an end you see that bounds he has compass remember when we talked about in the first sermon that a compass is describing a circle a compass is describing a curved surface he has compass the waters with bounds until the day and night come to an end so those those bounds are there those bounds are established now I want you to open up your packet and I'm gonna show you what why we don't know that much about these bounds look at number eight in your packet it's going to be a page from Wikipedia number eight in your packet looks like this is it's a page from Wikipedia and it says Antarctic Treaty system see that an artic treaty system so you're in page number eight look what it says I'm gonna read just the first sentence it says the Antarctic Treaty and related agreements collectively known as the Antarctic Treaty system regulate the international relations with respect to an order antarctica earth's only continent without a native human population if we're on the earth and there's just one continent on the bottom you think we're not going to go to it you think we're not going to just jump on it and just inhabit it we're on the earth people want to find the bounds of the earth they want they desire to inhabit certain places but you can't inhabit it something that's just an ice wall yeah I'm not saying that the ice wall doesn't continue out because it does but the reason that this treaty was established look in the next sentence it says for the purpose of the treaty system Antarctica is defined as the land as all of the land and ice shelves south of 60 degree latitude the treaty entered into force in 1961 and has 53 parties 53 countries have agreed to never just never inhabit and order them never never never and have Antarctica and what's their purpose let's look it says they the treaty sets aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve what what is in Antarctica that needs to be a preserve like what are you preserving ice that's all we got a we got to keep this ice here just in case you know we have our global warming we're gonna save this one place we're gonna go get our ice from this place go to and then it says a scientific preserve establishes freedom of scientific investigation and bans military activity except for the u.s. who has all of their military there and protects it with fighter jets if you go to Antarctica it's like you flew over the Pentagon I'm serious if there's a place if you just fly to Antarctica you just like don't let anybody know you're just like I'm gonna fly to an ARCA they'll shoot you down or they'll race you down if you don't stop because you're gonna Viet figure out that there's an end of the earth you'll figure that out they don't want us to know that and then it says since look at it says bands military activity then it says the treaty was the first arms control agreement established during the Cold War what else happened during the Cold War was when they were blowing up the fishbowl remember Operation fishbowl was all happening at the same time they're coming together during this time since September 2004 the Antarctic Treaty says Treaty Secretariat headquarters have been located in Argentina and then it says the next the next paragraph the treaty was open for signature in 1959 officially entered into force in 1961 the original signatories were the 12 countries active in Antarctica the international geo centrifugal Year in 1957 and that says the 12 countries that had significant interest in Antarctica were Argentina Australia Belgium Chile France Japan New Zealand Norway South Africa the Soviet Union the United Kingdom and the United States those countries knew that Antarctica was an ice wall they established this treaty to not let the information get out and now if you've read the last sentence these countries had established over 50 and Arctic stations for the igy the treaty was diplomatic expression of the operational and scientific cooperation cooperation of many nations that have been achieved on the ice so the reason for this an artic treaty system is so that the information never gets out that there's an end to the earth they don't want you to know that they don't want you to realize that Antarctica is not a Content a continent to be inhabited they want you to rethink that Antarctica is just some scientific region where we're just doing a lot of studies you know we're just finding out how cold it can get here let's just figure that out first know what they want they don't want you to see the end they don't want you to see that the world has ends and I want you to turn to one more thing look at page number nine page number nine these are pictures and you can actually do research on other people who have travelled ain't by see like I'm talking before this military band where they just say I traveled around the earth and I could not get past the ice wall there's there's papers of people that were actually you know trying to find other land you know trying to find trying to go out and explore in 1800s and the 1600s and they they literally said that they just came to a nice wall where they literally just had to travel around the whole earth in a nice wall and you can read their first-hand accounts of all this happening and there's people who have tried to fly to Antarctica and they were taken down by the military all this information is available to you but look at number nine these are the ice walls that are encasing their earth those don't look too small do that why don't you fall off the edge it's because of these giant ice walls that God has established when she says in job chapter 26 verse 10 he have compost the water with bounds until the day and night come to an end so until day and night are over these bounds are staying these bounds are established I want you to turn to Acts chapter 17 Acts chapter 17 Acts chapter 17 we're gonna look at verse 26 and there's a verse we used to kind of get rid of racism because it says and hath made of one blood all nations of men right so we're all of one blood but we don't look at the end of this verse and it says in acts 17 verse 26 all nations of men for to dwell on the face of the earth and hath determine the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation so God knows our bounds he has established it we're all of one blood we're all together you know we're all from the same gene pool and he knows our bounds he has set our bounds about turn to job chapter 38 job chapter 38 you know if this theory some people call it I don't the title of my sermon was the Flat Earth and not the Flat Earth theory was because I don't believe it to be a theory a theory or something you can't prove and if this theory wasn't true would I be able to find this much scripture on it two sermons worth of Scripture 12 pages turn to a job chapter 38 verse 8 who shut up the sea with doors when it break forth as is it issued out of a womb when I made the cloud the garment thereof so the cloud is the covering of the Seas and the thick darkness a swaddling band for it so the thick darkness above the clouds a swaddling band for it and break up it for a decreed place and set bars and doors and said hitherto shalt thou come but no further he's talking about the sea hitherto shalt thou come but no further and here shall thy proud waves be stayed the bars and doors the ends of the earth what's holding in the sea is the bars and doors and he said thy proud waves will be stayed so nothing no water is breaking through these bars no water is breaking through an article or the ice wall that God has created to bound near to bind it together turn to Psalm 103 Psalm 103 I'm gonna read a verse from job chapter 28 and verse 24 says he looketh to the ends of the earth and see it under the whole heaven job 28 24 says he looketh to the end to the earth and cieth under the whole heaven so if you got the firmament on top he can obviously see the ends of the earth and he sees under remember the firmament is heaven under the whole heaven it's all right there in his vision he's seeing all of it and then you're in Psalm 103 look in verse 11 it says for as the heaven is high above the earth so great is his mercy toward them that fear him so remember as the heaven in in Genesis 1 verse 8 it said the firmament is heaven he called the firmament heaven so as the heaven is high above the earth so the firmament at the center is the highest point because remember is like a dome a glass dome if the high as high it is above the earth so great is his mercy towards them that fear him and as far as the east is from the west so far hath he removed our transgressions from us so mind you there's two ways to look at this God could establish in north south east and west in the sense that he could make not north the center but make north like over here and west over here in east over here and south over here so that's a very long distance or if you look at it the Flat Earth model with the disk because the disk has magnetism which is how we describe the Sun rotating at different paths around the center if this is the North in the same way that you could think of it I guess with the globe but if this is the north and the east and the West are relative to the north the East and the West are pretty much infinite right because you're going from if you're always traveling to the right in a circle you're always traveling east if you're looking at it that way and if you're traveling this way you're always traveling west in a circle around the north because remember the north is the center and we're talking about circles east to west but also you know if God's thinking that the you know if God way is that the north is up here and east and west and south are here at least that's a very far distance like we know that for sure so but in the Flat Earth model the North is the center because it helps with understanding magnetism because the North Pole is the center that's why when your compass ports points north its pointing towards the center of the disk so when a disc has magnetism you think of north and south of the magnetism the north is the center point of the disk and then as you get farther out to the very outer spaces the very outer ends its itself and that's how the that's how seasons work on a flat earth because you have you have the Sun in the moon right and they're always traveling at different distances from the north but their compass in a full 24-hour period so you know if you live in this area when it's summer for you then the Sun is going to be very close but when it's winter it's getting farther and farther away and if you live in this area around the equator that's why the equator is always so hot is because the Sun will be around the equator the most if it's starting here and going out farther and then eventually coming back in it hits the equator twice right as it goes out and as it comes in that's why the equator is usually the hottest point that works on the Flat Earth model because you have the Sun coming in here for a season coming out there for a season then coming back in until it's summer and that's how the equator works and then when I tell you to turn your in so turn to Isaiah chapter 44 Isaiah chapter 44 look in verse 24 Isaiah 44 look in verse 24 and in verse 24 the Bible reads thus saith the LORD thy Redeemer he that formed thee from the womb I'm the Lord that maketh all things that stretcheth forth the heavens alone which spread at them abroad the earth by myself abroad the earth he's stretching the heavens above the earth and when you stretch something abroad you're usually stretch you'd across stretching it across a flat surface you're spreading something abroad like you would stretch forth a blanket over a bed the same concept this year he's stretching forth the heavens over the earth he has said it turn to Jeremiah chapter 10 and we're just going over a couple more verses that show that the earth has ends the earth has ends there's many many more verses I only got the 10 most important ones Jeremiah chapter 10 and verse 13 it says in verse 13 of Jeremiah 10 when he uttered his voice there is a multitude of waters in the heavens and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth he maketh lightnings with rain and bringing forth the winds out of his treasure so he is talking about the ends of the earth there's ends on a flat earth and in a job 28 verse 24 it says again the ends of the earth so now I want to show you that the Sun moves and not the earth and this verse is a real proof of this turn to Psalm chapter 19 some chapter 19 Psalm 19 and I'm gonna prove to you from the Bible that the Sun moves and not the earth you're in Psalm 19 but I want you to open up to the fourth page in your packet you should have a picture of a Sun in the fourth page of your packet I have a picture of four different pictures of Suns you might have a picture of one Sun and what what you're seeing here is the Sun with clouds in front of it but also clouds behind it you see those clouds behind the Sun and you should see that in your packet also you should see clouds behind the Sun you see these clouds behind the Sun do you know why that is it's because the Sun is rotating around the earth not outside of the earth there's no clouds in space there's no clouds there shouldn't be clouds behind the Sun it should be the fourth in your packet it's going to look different than this I have four different pictures you should have one picture in yours but you see that there's a cloud behind the Sun it's because the Sun is traveling within the firmament and they lied to you telling you it's ninety-three thousand miles away turn to the last page in your packet very last page this is a picture from a amateur weather balloon an amateur weather balloon and you're gonna see the Sun above the clouds you see the Sun right there above the clouds do you see that little hot spot under it that's only possible if the earth if the Sun is close to the earth you wouldn't have an isolated hot spot if the Sun was 93 million miles away because it would be hitting at the same point the whole side of the earth it would be hitting this entire whatever sphere is its whatever side of the Spirit that is shining on it would not be isolated but this is from an amateur weather balloon and you can see that the Sun and not only the flat horizon see the flat horizon but you see that the Sun right here has a hot spot directly under where it is located because the Sun is close to the earth and what it's showing you there is the heat coming down from the Sun so whoever is under the Sun that's why at 12 o'clock it feels the hottest when the Sun is directly above you and you start to feel the temperature increase as the Sun gets closer to eat right so when the Sun starts setting remember we're talking about a field of view the Sun is always parallel to the earth it never goes up or down it's a matter of perspective so the Sun is when it's coming at you it looks like it's rising up in the same way when you walk closer to a building it looks like the buildings getting taller but the building remains the same height so when the Sun is getting closer to you it looks like it's rising up and you ever notice that at 12 o'clock when it's directly above you it's the hottest point of the day and there's the most heat is because the Sun is close to you and when it's that close you're feeling that hot spot you're feeling the hotter it is the closer it is to you right below you that's why at 12 o'clock it's usually the hottest point of the where you are located because it's directly under the Sun and as the Sun gets farther away it looks like it's going down but actually remind you if it's coming towards you and it looks like it's getting higher it's just a matter of your perspective and then as it goes away it will look like it's going down but it remember all the points are converging when we talked about that fall way how you know it'll look like the top of the ceiling is coming down but really the ceiling is that the same exact height from the floor so it's just that you're matter of your perspective and that's exactly what's happening there so you're in Psalm 19 look at verse 4 it says their line is gone out through all the earth remind you we were talking about that line right the line just measuring a flat surface so the line has gone out through all the earth you wouldn't use the word line to describe all the earth right but that's not even the most important part of this verse I like that verse you know I like that part of it but look what it says their words to the end of the world in him that has set a tabernacle for the Sun so what's the subject of these few verses the Sun right setting a tabernacle for the Sun which he has you know with the firmament which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber rejoices at a strong man to run a race his going forth is from the end of heaven and his circuit unto the ends of it and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof so a circuit of the Sun is describing the Sun moving in a circuit not us moving around the Sun so when you think of a flat earth and we remember we keep going back to this picture it's the Sun that is circuiting around the earth the Sun circuits around the earth and it says his circuit on to the ends of it so it does remember we're talking about is starting in the center of the north and then circuiting out towards the ends and then coming back in for a season so it's circuit does reach the ends of the earth and then it comes back to the center and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof so it is income fussing the whole earth and let me just prove to you that circuit means circle in Ecclesiastes chapter 1 verse 6 it says the win goeth towards the south and turneth about to the north and whirl it's about whirl a--the about continually and the wind returneth again so when you think of something going out and the returning again going out and returning again according to his circuits so we're talking about the circuit of the wind going from the north to the south remember if you're thinking of a disc it's going from the north which is the center of the disc to the south and it's saying it's whirling about continually if it's whirling about continuing it's not just going straight it's not going from the center of the of the flat earth all the way to the end of the earth if it's whirling about continually it's going in a circuit and Ecclesiastes chapter 1 verse 6 says the wind returneth again according to its circuit so a circuit is just making a pact a circular path and in job chapter 9 verse 7 turns a joke chapter 9 verse 7 because remember I'm trying to prove to you that the Sun moves not the earth the Sun moves not the earth joke chapter nine verse seven it says which commanded the Sun talking about God and it rise if not and see lift up the Stars so remember we talked about the Sun rising and falling is a matter of perspective so if the Sun is rising it's it's moving closer to you right it's rotating its circuit circuiting closer to you if God can command the Sun that it rises if not that means the Sun is no longer spinning the Sun is no longer going around the earth he's stopping the circuit of the Sun he's commanding the Sun and it rise if not it didn't say the earth rise a--the not it didn't say the earth stops spinning it doesn't say the earth stopped its tilt it says he commands the Sun and it rise it not is talking about the Sun making its rounds its circuit about earth turn to Joshua chapter 10 Joshua chapter 10 so God has control of the Sun God controls the Sun to rise and fall it's not the earth that rises and falls it's the Sun turn to Joshua chapter 10 in verse twelve we're gonna look at Joshua 10 verse 12 so in Joshua chapter 10 looking verse 12 it says then speak Joshua to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up the amorite before the children of Israel and he said in the sight of Israel son stand thou still upon Gibeon and thou moon in the valley of a Hajj alone and the Sun Stood Still and the moon stayed so what is this saying it's that saying that the Sun and the moon are the ones that are rotating it's the Sun and the moon that he's commanding to stay still he didn't say earth rotate thou not he didn't say Earth spin it out not he said Sun stand now still thou and moon because the Sun and the moon are rotating and then it says and the Sun Stood Still and the moon stayed so the Sun and the moon didn't move and then look what happens from that until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies and then it says so the Sun Stood Still in the midst of heaven and hasted not to go down mind you that's the perspective he said not to go around the earth he said not to go down about a whole day and there was no day like it before or after and the Lord hearkened unto the voice of a man so he's saying the Sun did stay still in the midst of heaven in the midst of heaven so it's the Sun that is staying still in the firmament of heaven and not going down or not rotating around the earth because when it's talking about this talking about from the perspective of a man so if it's not going down it means it's not rotating past him it's not leaving his field of view it's the Sun that is staying and when the Sun rises it's talking about the starting of a day and then coming back down you know that's that's but it's the the Sun is actually staying parallel but it looks like it's going up and down just a matter of perspective but it's the Sun that's not it's the Sun that's moving not us it's the Sun that is being stayed and the moon that is being stayed why would he stop the moon if you didn't believe the Sun verse why would he stop the moon what would that matter what would it matter to stop the moon the reason he stopped the moon is because the moon is giving a light by night so if you just stop the Sun the moon's gonna come up and just hit the Sun it's good it's good not gonna have the proper rotation around the earth if you stop the moon if you stop the Sun if you didn't care about the Sun part and you just like oh he stopped the earth why would he stop the moon the moon could just keep rotating the moon has nothing to do with it the moon isn't gonna affect anything in a globe earth it's because there are two great lights and you stop both of them because they both have to be stopped in an enclosed system and in turn to Habbakuk Habbakuk verse three I mean chapter three Habakkuk chapter three verse 11 it says in chapter 3 verse 11 says the sun and moon stood still in their habitation at the light of thine arrows they went and at the shining of that glittering spear so the Sun and the moon are what's rotating it's not the earth whenever it's saying it's there standing still it's talking about a miracle something that happened that was weird something that was crazy something that God did it's a miraculous thing to make the Sun and Moon stop because they are what's giving light upon the earth it's not the earth that's rotating around the Sun it's God who's rotating the Sun around the earth turn to it with that in mind turn to 2nd Kings chapter 20 second Kings chapter 20 second Kings chapter 20 looking verse 8 says and Hezekiah said unto Isaiah what shall be the sign that the Lord will heal me and that I shall go up onto the house the Lord the third day and Isaiah said this sign shot that I'll have in the Lord that the Lord will do the thing that he has spoken shall the shadow go forward 10 degrees or back 10 degrees and Hezekiah answered is a light thing for the Shack the shadow to go down 10 degrees nay but let the shadow return backwards 10 degrees backwards 10 degrees he's talking about the Sun should it go forward 10 degrees should I make them should I ask God to make the Sun rotate more so that that's that shadow will go 10 degrees forward or should I make it rotate backwards and he says it's a light thing that'll go forwards because you know it's always going forwards make it go backwards make the Sun and the moon go backwards and in verse 11 it says Isaiah the prophet cried unto the Lord and brought the shadow 10 degrees backwards because it's the Sun that's rotating around the earth he's bringing the Sun backwards by which it had gone down in the dial of a house so why you preach on this subject you know why did I preach a sermon on the flat earth because it's a big lie it's a huge lie to believe that you're on a globe and you're meaningless the whole purpose of this lie is so that you feel like there's no God it's so light you feel unimportant and so that you feel you can get away with anything if nobody's watching you but if God is right above you and he's looking down upon you like a grasshopper he's watching your every mood move physically he's watching you and he cares about you remember the earth was created to be inhabited he cares about you if he's above you he cares about you if you're all he created you know if the earth is the ones thing the earth is the one system that's what matters then the earth becomes a big deal but if the earth is just something dot a small dot in the midst of a huge galaxy in the midst of billions of other galaxies then you're nothing then who knows there could be life forms elsewhere there could have been a big bang there could have been evolution all these theories are based upon this big lie and when you look at the Bible I think it's pretty clear that God created us for a reason and he created the earth for a reason and it is a the main deal the big thing turn to Jeremiah chapter 8 this is a bit less verses I'm gonna read the world is sinful the world wants to believe that there is no God because they don't want their deeds to be made manifest they don't want their deeds to be known they don't want people to rebuke them for fornicating they don't want people to rebuke them for sinning they don't want to believe in a God so they make him very far away they make him billions of light-years away they make him billions of galaxies away if you believe you're in a solar system then you got billions of light years until anything but if you believe you're in the flat earth system God is right above you he's right there and he's looking down upon you because he cares about you he cares about us and that's why Jesus came down that's why he ascended back up why would Jesus have to ascend if we were a spinning ball in a huge galaxy in some crazy universe he would just have to go poof and disappear because ascending would do nothing he would go into some vacuum in space he would go into some place that didn't matter he ascended up because God's throne is above us his throne is above the firmament turn to Jeremiah chapter 8 look in verse 1 it says at that time saith the Lord they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah and the bones of his Prince's and the bones of the priests and the bones of the prophets and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem out of their graves and they shall spread them before the Sun and the moon and all the hosts of heaven whom they have loved and whom they have served and after whom they have walked and whom they have sought and whom they have worshipped they shall not be gathered nor be buried they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth and death shall be chosen life by the residue of them that remain of this evil family which remain in all the places whether I've driven them safe the Lord of Hosts so the reason that people make the Sun and the moon and all these galaxies so important is because they don't want to worship God they want to worship the hosts of heaven they want to worship their own God they want to worship anything that they can create so when the Sun becomes the center of your universe and when the Sun becomes the center of what you believe your mind isn't focused on God it's focused on the things he created and that's the path to a reprobate so that's why the world wants people to believe in this but it's a lie I'll just close this and word of Prayer Heavenly Father I thank you so much for your word Lord and I pray that you will help many people to see your truth I pray that you will open the eyes of anyone that hears this sermon I pray that you will really grow people in your word and grow closer to you in their walk with you Lord and we just pray these things in Jesus name Amen [Music] [Music] ",2

89,DAo_CDPDKA0,good day everyone I hope you have a good day today so my topic for today is about area 51 so more people are interested in this facility through what we call this is specific place because they thought that there's an alien down there but in fact in reality it's just a military facility in a laboratory to develop a specific specific military equipments to combat for for military purposes so when you expand your consciousness or your understanding it is obvious that you see things clearly as the way they are in area 51 it's just a military facility and a laboratory to develop a biological weapons so it is what it is there's no alien down there but they've they pay the people or scientists to to be interviewed in the public so that they can persuade people's perception that there's an alien but in fact there's no alien down there it's just a plain military or military facility and laboratory for developing biological weapons so that's the way it is but they just want you to to be persuaded it's a distraction so as a matter of fact it's a distraction to instill fear that or twin-stick to direct your attention to this to this trivial trivial stuff that's an important in your life that's why they do this that that they are spreading information that there's an agent down there but in fact there's no alien there it's just fuel military facility and for biological weapons so probably that's all so thank you for watching this video and if you like to see my other videos thumbs up and subscribe so thank you thank you for watching ,2

91,ZODE_sRMiT0,according to a report in WorldNetDaily some of the richest men and women in the world met secretly in New York recently when the world's wealthiest individuals hold secret meetings it's time to pay attention in 1910 the six wealthiest men in the world met a Jekyll Island Georgia that meeting resulted in the creation three years later of the largest criminal enterprise ever devised the Federal Reserve so-called judging from the list of participants the recent meeting in New York may result in something even more monumental the London Times identified them as Bill Gates David Rockefeller Ted Turner Oprah Winfrey Warren Buffett George Soros and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg based on the Forbes magazine list of billionaires the room had a net worth of about a hundred and twenty billion dollars with all the bailout figures we've heard recently that doesn't sound like that much believe me it is a hundred and twenty billion dollars is about equal to the annual budget for all of New York State from New York City to Buffalo and everything in between the meeting which took place in early May was at the home of Sir Paul nurse a British Nobel Prize winning biochemist and president of Rockefeller University Microsoft founder Bill Gates called a meeting the London Times reported the informal afternoon session was so discreet that some of the billionaires aides were told they were at security briefings discreet is the British Way of saying secret I do not believe that is coincidental that this meeting came only a couple of weeks after another super secret and more powerful group met in the secrecy in Greece the Bilderberg Group they have advocated a one-world government for at least a century they also see themselves as the elite saviors of mankind according to The Times the billionaires were each given 15 minutes to present their favorite cause over dinner they discussed how they might settle on an umbrella cause that can harness their interest taking their cue from gates the report said they agreed that population control was the number one issue experts say the global population will top 7 billion in 2012 according to reports at the meeting Bill Gates outlined a plan to cap the global population at eight point three billion it all sounds so civilized doesn't it here's the less politically correct but more accurate version a group of unelected liberals with more money than many governments have just decided how many people will be permitted to live this group of self-appointed governors will now have to draw up criteria to be used to decide who will not be permitted to live and how they will die it can and will be dressed up in polite in civil terms but in the end it means certain people will have to die the meeting was billed as a meeting of philanthropists wanting to do good but one can put lipstick and pearls on a pig it'll still be a pig and the final analysis there's only way one way to cap a population by deciding who's permitted to live and who for the good of all must die ,2
92,areIv5h_vss,[Music] history tells us that adolf hitler demented betrayed and um lacking in any hope of victory at all retires to his private courses in the bunker with his wife ava brown and they commit suicide ava brown probably taking a cyanide capsule hitler by shooting himself in the head those bodies are then carried upstairs and are put in a shallow grave covered in 50 liters of petrol set ablaze and that's it end of history end of hitler the first anyone knew of hitler's death was on may the 1st 1945 when german radio made a dramatic announcement [Music] it was the first clue says gerard williams that the death of adolf hitler wasn't what it appeared hitler's death is not announced by the allies finding his body hitler's death is announced by the german government by the nazis [Music] the problem with that is this is one of the greatest propagandist nations ever to run the earth hitler's dead say that's not season and we are just meant to believe it [Music] despite the radio report the allies were unable to verify hitler's death at the time of the announcement the battle of berlin was still raging [Music] a day after the broadcast on may the 2nd 1945 the soviet army accompanied by a bbc reporter finally seized hitler's bunker and made a grim discovery they found the body of a man with a lock of black hair on the right hand side of his face and a little black moustache at first glance it looked like the nazi leader but it was soon established that it wasn't and they looked at them more closely and their doctors came to the conclusion that it was what they call a bad double of hitler and not hitler himself body doubles were widely used in the second world war stalin was known to have numerous and churchill at least one historians are certain that hitler used them too it's not clear if the dead man was a hitler body double or not but the fact is no one reported finding the body of the real adolf hitler in 1945 [Music] i'm pretty convinced that two people probably did die in the bunker at the end of april beginning of may 1945 but they weren't out of hitler and over brown hitler and ava are substituted in the dying days of the bunker in berlin two double replaced them and it was those who were murdered and their bodies disposed of later [Music] the conspiracy would have us believe that this audacious switch was masterminded by hitler's private secretary martin bormann to get to hitler at any level at all you had to go through martin borman borman controlled the door he was the gatekeeper to him a committed nazi borman was determined to see his beloved fuhrer survive the war born is a very committed personally to adolf hitler he's his friend he's his leader he's his fuhrer and he wants to see him live what he realizes is that if he wants to keep his friend alive and he wants to keep himself alive is that they have to die there has to be a final end to them there has to be no reason for people to come looking for them i believe that at the end of april 1945 the real hitler along with ava brown was spirited out of the bunker to the right chancery and that's where the exchange took place the body doubles come back and it's done it's a slightest hand gerard williams maintains that only bormann and gestapo chief heinrich muller knew about the switch the people who would have seen body doubles in the bunker for the short period that remained while they were still alive would have caught fleeting glimpses of hitler in his uniform over in her cotton dress they would not have got close and when word reached bormann that the real adolf hitler and ava brown had successfully escaped the body doubles were executed [Music] so if hitler didn't die in 1945 where did he go [Music] the rumors everywhere oh you can see in a lot of the sort of gutter yellow papers of the time in america and in britain there'll be rumors of hitler being discovered in the antarctic [Music] the incredible theory proposed by renegade historian douglas dietrich is that the nazis built a secret colony in the south pole what was established was basing for initially two hundred thousand aryans constructed with underground factory systems underground hospitals uh even daycare facilities in which the nazi leadership would retreat and be defended by a resistance movement and the remainder of its forces the creation of such a massive fortress in antarctica may seem fantastical but vast underground tunnels discovered in austria at the end of the war are some believe proof that the idea isn't as far-fetched as it sounds this site is possibly the third reich's biggest underground site with an area of around a million square meters amateur historian andreas villa has explored this nazi tunnel complex in austria that was built to accommodate 60 000 men [Music] in 1938 the nazis did send a team to the south pole they said it was for scientific purposes but the man in charge of the mission was no scientist it was hermann goering the chief of the german air force one of the reasons for the germans going to antarctica was to acquire territory because they had imperial ambitions germany felt that it had the right to claim a piece of antarctica as its own territory but why commandeer land in one of the most inhospitable places in the world douglas dietrich thinks he knows the answer the major point of that expedition was to establish the feasibility of long-term colonization of the last truly unexplored continent on earth fueling this idea that the nazi's plan to build a stronghold in the south pole is a boast made by a top-ranking nazi in 1943. admiral dernitz the commander of the german u-boat fleet is reported to have openly talked about an impregnable fortress in another part of the world that he claimed to have built for hitler it would seem to me if if he had built such a base it'd be much more likely to be in greenland than it would be in antarctica simply because that's the theater of war in which germany was fighting its major battles not in antarctica which was several tens of thousands of miles away but the conspiracy theorists disagree they say the arrival of two u-boats in argentina a staging post for the south pole in june 1945 two months after the end of the war is evidence that dernitz fortress was in antarctica you ,2

think some of them are very very important and i know kevin hart had his car crash and there's a lot of big celebrity news going around but i think this is more important i think that we should probably talk about this a little bit so first article here not sure if that's coming through but you can see the dude screaming ah ah why is he screaming maybe you can't read the text i'll read it for you swedes are getting implants in their hands to replace cash and credit cards this from earlier this year july 14 2019 thousands of people in sweden are having futuristic microchips implanted into their skin to carry out everyday activities and replace credit cards and cash more than 4 000 people have already had the sci-fish chips about the size of a grain of rice inserted into the hands with the pioneers predicting will soon join millions will soon join it to make it global so this has been happening for years and years and years and years and years but continue to happen they say millions very soon there's already four thousand look at the dude's face ah i'll read the headline and uh if i remember i'll try to put it in the links people sometimes like oh how come you don't put it in the links how come you don't put the comments the links in the comments hey it's called google you can just google type in a few words that's what i do it's not very hard back in the day you have to go through the card catalog you have to look things up by the dewey decimal system just type you don't have to type stuff anymore you just say stuff pull this article up so swedes are getting implants in their hands to replace cash credit cards if you guys want to look into that more but that's happening everywhere i've covered this a million times but i also wanted to cover that again to transition to this article probably tough to see but you guys can easily google it facial and emotional recognition how one man is advancing artificial intelligence and this is a pretty lengthy interview right here it's very interesting i suggest you you all check it out i mean i gotta keep the videos somewhat short anyways just because people's time uh attention span is very short including my own so we gotta catch people here so especially people that are not awake to this so please share this information uh if you can great donate patreon that's awesome patreon forward slash demand the

now you can go back to youtube fourth last demand the truth check out the shows i've done anybody that's watched the terminator knows that there's something called skynet and skynet is the computer robot artificial intelligence of the future that sends the t1 thousands the terminators back to murder humans so then the chinese were like hmm like that idea so they took that name and developed facial recognition software so there's already a million people over there and people always talk about oh they talk about the black mirror oh you see the new black mirror don't you check this out well the black mirror with the social credit score i haven't watched many but that's already here in real life in china right now like if you smoke or you jaywalk or you say something that's not

europe everywhere facial and emotional recognition i've already did entire videos i've done two videos on the same one where the international business times in 2015 talked about returning vets getting brain chips for their emotions then this is from last year but this is part of the story this is out of reuters meet tesla's new bondholder billionaire george soros now people were thinking for a long time that tesla was cool elon musk was cool he got tesla and he's young and he's he's smoking pot on joe rogan this guy's cool man he's going to save us well last year soros invested heavily with uh mr musk there and then what what happens what what happens next this is from mit technology review what's new and what isn't about elon musk's brain computer interface it's state of the art but neuralink still has a long way to go i've done videos on neuralink before i've done videos on all this stuff before i've documented i've done videos my radio show did this thank you everybody please share this information because it's one thing when people get in the streets and yell and fight each other antifa versus straight pride i get so many views on that video because

think that uh i for one have been lied to by the church the government the school systems hollywood all these people so excuse me if i'm a little leery about taking a brain interface or getting a microchip this is it's crazy i've been talking about this for years other people have been talking this for way longer than me people like doc marquis my mentor former co-host rest in peace doc marquis shout out to doc marquis these people have been talking about this for years for literally years and look just going to read the headlines one more time to you this is what we need to have a conversation as a society about this forget democrats forget republicans swedes are getting implants in their hands to replace cash and credit cards facial and emotional recognition artificial intelligence we have skynet already in china we've got soros being the new bondholder of tesla then we've got musk thinking he's a cool cool dude he's introducing neuralink and he says if we don't merge with a.i ai will take us over well excuse me i want to be human sorry and these are the same people keep in mind that always end up being associated with pedophiles and pedophiles get arrested around them and stuff like that so it's just weird so i'm about to wrap this up if you guys have anything that you want to say in the chat uh go ahead and ask me any questions that's cool i'll stay

94,UX5OwBnhksY,hey everybody welcome back listen you know one of the big things out there like i was saying last couple days is this lie about um the threat of global warming and the the marxist failed marxist communism socialism have taken this as their next thing to subdue the earth if you will basically make everybody poor make techno technology uh less of a um just to control people it's all about freedom they don't want you to have the technology okay they want to control you to subdue you for whatever reason um and i think it's for their own glory and i think it's for satanic purposes but that's you know and this guy grant jeffries wrote this great book about 10 years ago or eight years ago because he's dead now the global warming deception by grant that's his name grant jeffrey he's written many prophecy books too but in the chapter on the propaganda campaign that advances global uh government because that's what it's all going to end up doing um he talks about we need to i'm going to read a little bit we need to examine on page 56 the philosophy and underlying political beliefs of those who espouse man-made global warming alarmism as we have seen they are committed to redistributing the world's wealth further we need to examine their hidden agenda to achieve global government through abolishing independent sovereign national governments their underlying belief system is animated by two fundamental beliefs the first is an attitude that holds that the vast increase of wealth and rise in the standard of living in industrial nations is inherently bad for the environment in light of the relentless growth of technology and desire for prosperity and material goods many my environmentalists believe humanity would be better off and healthier if we embraced a less technological and significantly poorer lifestyle however history reveals that we can only begin to solve the profound environmental health and economical problems facing humanity through the wise use of technology and the promotion of wealth these goals are best accomplished with the availability of inexpensive reliable energy which is oil of course in natural gas nuclear power and clean coal this fuels a rise in the level of public health economic freedom in the standard 11. these other sources that they point to are not reliable they're not plentiful and they're not cheap um and and they they have a carbon footprint of themselves you know these solar batteries they suck up a lot of you know i mean if you want to go that way i wouldn't even go that way but i mean man-made carbon dioxide is only three percent of all the earth anyway earth's going to be producing 97 so if you take all the men um co2 away you're only going to go down three percent the second underlying belief that appears to motivate the global warming alignments is a deeply held attitude that the environment is extremely fragile and must be protected from any possible modification by human activity as a result of global warming propaganda many environmentally focused individuals believe the earth's climate is being pushed past an imaginary never before experienced tipping point the propagandists want you believe that we are in danger it's all about fear of accelerating rising global temperatures past a point of no return now this is a lie okay continuing even in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence that disproves global warming continuous propaganda has overwhelmed the common sense of millions of western citizens if you repeat a lie often enough no matter how fantastic the claim people will eventually accept it that's what's going on here same thing with covert the global warming movement has carried out the most successful propaganda campaign since the nazi big like campaign in the years leading up to world war ii assisting in the selling the lie is the news meter media ross galsband former editor of boston globe advised journalists to sensitive views research and studies of skeptics who contradict and disprove global warming orthodoxy galsband went even further to suggest as far back as july 2000 that reporters should not even report the arguments made by climate skeptics quote unquote not only do journalists have a responsibility to report what skeptical scientists have to say let me repeat that not only do journalists not have a responsibility to report what scientists have to say about global warming they have a responsibility not to report what the scientists say so that's in quote unquote by this guy gel spring former editor of boston globe um so that's that's one example and i'm gonna have some quotes about from obama next time about this propaganda machine that's controlling the flow of information and that's um selling a lie over and over and over and over again until you believe it and and now much like covert we're ready to give up everything for something that's totally improving that's gonna destroy our standard of living and live us make us all live on the streets so they can just wrap us up and throw us away anyway they just want i think they only want 500 million people alive on earth and you know it's funny because all these policies over the years to to help quarter coat to help people of course the dependent society in this dependent society is unable to help themselves obviously and they have become such an economic burden that governments can't function anymore so they have to eliminate these people i should do a video on this alone because that is the only way they can survive and the earth has very limited resources so it's either the state or the people the state just can't continue so that's why there's going to be this need to reduce population even back when i was uh going to school i had a professor who was gay by the way he's gotten into all kinds of problems um since then he's been arrested multiple times chasing minors all over the place and very nice guy by the way but he gave everybody in the class an a um and he had his boyfriend coming to take over the class when he went down the protest uh the cougar ran and and if from you know south africa there back in the day but um you know his idea was like you could he didn't really say it but you know populations going straight up you know flatline and straight up that you know we got to do something you know and that's why he's gay right well you know these say people have no understanding of god no trust with god all right and they're actually playing into satan's hand in this one world government so they're serving the god of this age satan unknowingly right and um at the wrong peril because if you're not born again you get you you're left in your own sin you know why want to take advantage of what jesus did for you and get covered instead of being left in your own sin and so be born again be spiritually born today and you'll live forever and you start to see through these lives you know this world isn't the end there's ages to come but these lies are you know satan's the father of all lies right jesus talked to many people accused you know leaders of of their father being satan you know um so while these leaders their fathers are satan i would say and if they don't find god god help them because there was you know dying in their sin you don't want to die in your sin you want to die in jesus who died for your sin okay all right so that's the message today glad we got one out there today kind of crazy right now but um very important all right i'm gonna say goodbye have a great one bye ,3
95,JYxJkq5B6ec,hey so today is november 23rd 2020. i'm here at the federal plaza in new york city at the fbi field office i just reported of a case of organized crime involving private investigators they possess police fake police officers fake doctor to frame me to have mental illness i'm trying to expose this crime and have the fbi get involved my case started in canada calgary canada where i i was involved in this case where private investigators has been harassing me and my son and also the doctors used false reports to frame me to mental illness when i try to report of private investigators as well as review doctors or reveal doctors male practice so in an incident where the doctor said i have ovarian cancer and he did a big surgery on me which i didn't have ovarian cancer so he falsified information which i tried to review of the corruption of the doctrine of police in calgary canada but i never got any help from the police nor the rcmp i went all the way to the rcmp headquarters in ottawa to report of my case they wouldn't do an investigation they allowed this undercover operation to continue involving private investigators and so i came here all the way to new york to get help medical help and as well as law enforcement help these private investigators release toxins in my food and i have evidence of this of how they did it for them so i have evidence of this fake police officer he goes by well as you can see that on on his shirt he's it says lieutenant cruz um as well this is not a real police officer he's a fake police officer and this woman is a fake airport airport supervisor she posed as an airport supervisor because i tried to fly out to switzerland to get help or declare asylum but they knew they knew about my trip so they set this woman up to be a airport supervisor and deny my rights to board the plane i went to i i went to the security the airport security and they confirmed she does not work at the airport they told me to report this case to the port authority air airport police so i went to the port authority police at the jfk airport location and they set me up with this fake police officer okay this is he he said that he's uh lieutenant j cruz he's not a real police officer and so i reported to the nypd and nypd told me to contact that and what the internal affairs the nypd internal affairs they told me they don't do investigations so again they tried to cover up this case and so i went to the fbi to report about my case several times back in september 2019 the fbi would not do an investigation even that i have evidence of my case of this undercover operation that i'm being set up and meant to be an entrapment and the fbi won't open a fair investigation okay they allow this undercover operation to continue i just submitted this report again today and to and they again they told me to come back in two weeks or wait for a response nobody would give me a response that fbi would not contact me they keep on
